the golden age when men were brothers all
the golden rule their law and god their king
when no fierce beasts did through the forests roam
nor poisonous reptiles crawl upon the ground
when trees bore only wholesome luscious fruits
and thornless roses breathed their sweet perfumes
when sickness sin and sorrow were unknown
and tears but spoke of joy too deep for words
when painless death but led to higher life
a life that knows no end in that bright world
whence angels on the ladder jacob saw
descending talk with man as friend to friend
that age of purity and peace had passed
but left a living memory behind
cherished and handed down from sire to son
through all the scattered peoples of the earth
a living prophecy of what this world
this sad and sinful world might yet become
the silver age an age of faith not sight
came next when reason ruled instead of love
when men as through a glass but darkly saw
what to their fathers clearly stood revealed
in god's own light of love illumined truth
of which the sun that rising paints the east
and whose last rays with glory gild the west
is but an outbirth then were temples reared
and priests 'mid clouds of incense sang his praise
who out of densest darkness called the light
and from his own unbounded fullness made
the heavens and earth and all that in them is
then landmarks were first set lest men contend
for god's free gifts that all in peace had shared
then laws were made to govern those whose sires
were laws unto themselves then sickness came
and grief and pain attended men from birth to death
but still a silver light lined every cloud
and hope was given to cheer and comfort men
the brazen age brilliant but cold succeeds
this was an age of knowledge art and war
when the knights errant of the ancient world
adventures seeking roamed with brazen swords
which by a wondrous art then known now lost
were hard as flint and edged to cut a hair
or cleave in twain a warrior armor clad
and armed with shields adorned by vulcan's art
wonder of coming times and theme for bards
then science searched through nature's heights and depths
heaven's canopy thick set with stars was mapped
the constellations named and all the laws searched out
that guide their motions rolling sphere on sphere
then men by reasonings piled up mountain high
thought to scale heaven and to dethrone heaven's king
whose imitators weak with quips and quirks
and ridicule would now destroy all sacred things
this age great homer and old hesiod sang
and gods they made of hero artist bard
at length this twilight of the ages fades
and starless night now sinks upon the world
an age of iron cruel dark and cold
on asia first this outer darkness fell
once seat of paradise primordial peace
perennial harmony and perfect love
a despot's will was then a nation's law
an idol's car crushed out poor human lives
and human blood polluted many shrines
then human speculation made of god
a shoreless ocean distant waveless vast
of truth that sees not and unfeeling love
whence souls as drops were taken back to fall
absorbed and lost when countless ages passed
they should complete their round as souls of men
of beasts of birds and of all creeping things
and even worse the cruel iron castes
one caste too holy for another's touch
had every human aspiration crushed
the common brotherhood of man destroyed
and made all men but pharisees or slaves
and worst of all and what could e'en be worse
woman bone of man's bone flesh of his flesh
the equal partner of a double life
who in the world's best days stood by his side
to lighten every care and heighten every joy
and in the world's decline still clung to him
she only true when all beside were false
when all were cruel she alone still kind
light of his hearth and mistress of his home
sole spot where peace and joy could still be found
woman herself cast down despised was made
slave to man's luxury and brutal lust
then war was rapine havoc needless blood
infants impaled before their mothers' eyes
women dishonored mutilated slain
parents but spared to see their children die
then peace was but a faithless hollow truce
with plots and counter plots the dagger's point
and poisoned cup instead of open war
and life a savage grim conspiracy
of mutual murder treachery and greed
o dark and cruel age! o cruel creeds!
o cruel men! o crushed and bleeding hearts
that from the very ground in anguish cry
is there no light no hope no help no god
northward from ganges' stream and india's plains
an ancient city crowned a lofty hill
whose high embattled walls had often rolled
the surging angry tide of battle back
walled on three sides but on the north a cliff
at once the city's quarry and its guard
cut out in galleries with vaulted roofs
upborne upon cyclopean columns vast
chiseled with art their capitals adorned
with lions elephants and bulls life size
once dedicate to many monstrous gods
before the aryan race as victors came
then prisons granaries and magazines
now only known to bandits and wild beasts
this cliff extending at each end bends north
and rises in two mountain chains that end
in two vast snow capped himalayan peaks
between which runs a glittering glacial stream
a mighty moving mass of crystal ice
crushing the rocks in its resistless course
from which bursts forth a river that had made
of all this valley one great highland lake
which on one side had burst its bounds and cut
in myriad years a channel through the rock
so narrow that a goat might almost leap
from cliff to cliff these cliffs so smooth and steep
the eagles scarce could build upon their sides
this yawning chasm so deep one scarce could hear
the angry waters roaring far below
this stream guided by art now fed a lake
above the city and behind this cliff
which guided thence in channels through the rock
fed many fountains sending crystal streams
through every street and down the terraced hill
and through the plain in little silver streams
spreading the richest verdure far and wide
here was the seat of king suddhodana
his royal park walled by eternal hills
where trees and shrubs and flowers all native grew
for in its bounds all the four seasons met
from ever laughing ever blooming spring
to savage winter with eternal snows
here stately palms the banyan's many trunks
darkening whole acres with its grateful shade
and bamboo groves with graceful waving plumes
the champak with its fragrant golden flowers
asokas one bright blaze of brilliant bloom
the mohra yielding food and oil and wine
the sacred sandal and the spreading oak
the mountain loving fir and spruce and pine
and giant cedars grandest of them all
planted in ages past and thinned and pruned
with that high art that hides all trace of art
were placed to please the eye and show their form
in groves in clumps in jungles and alone
here all a forest seemed there open groves
with vine clad trees vines hanging from each limb
a pendant chain of bloom with shaded drives
and walks with rustic seats cool grots and dells
with fountains playing and with babbling brooks
and stately swans sailing on little lakes
while peacocks rainbow tinted shrikes pheasants
glittering like precious stones parrots and birds
of all rich plumage fly from tree to tree
the whole scene vocal with sweet varied song
and here a widespread lawn bedecked with flowers
with clumps of brilliant roses grown to trees
and fields with dahlias spread not stiff and prim
like the starched ruffle of an ancient dame
but growing in luxuriance rich and wild
the colors of the evening and the rainbow joined
white scarlet yellow crimson deep maroon
blending all colors in one dazzling blaze
there orchards bend beneath their luscious loads
here vineyards climb the hills thick set with grapes
there rolling pastures spread where royal mares
high bred and colts too young for bit or spur
now quiet feed then as at trumpet's call
with lion bounds tails floating neck outstretched
nostrils distended fleet as the flying wind
they skim the plain and sweep in circles wide
nature's olympic copied ne'er excelled
here deer with dappled fawn bound o'er the grass
and sacred herds and sheep with skipping lambs
there great white elephants in quiet nooks
while high on cliffs framed in with living green
goats climb and seem to hang and feed in air
sweet spot with all to please and nothing to offend
here on a hill the royal palace stood
a gem of art and near another hill
its top crowned by an aged banyan tree
its sides clad in strange jyotismati grass
by day a sober brown but in the night
glowing as if the hill were all aflame
twin wonders to the dwellers in the plain
their guides and landmarks day and night
this glittering palace and this glowing hill
within above the palace rose a tower
which memory knew but as the ancient tower
foursquare and high an altar and a shrine
on its broad top where burned perpetual fire
emblem of boundless and eternal love
and truth that knows no night no cloud no change
long since gone out with that most ancient faith
in one great father source of life and light
still round this ancient tower strange hopes and fears
and memories handed down from sire to son
were clustered thick an army old men say
once camped against the city when strange lights
burst from this tower blinding their dazzled eyes
they fled amazed nor dared to look behind
the people bloody war and cruel bondage saw
on every side and they at peace and free
and thought a power to save dwelt in that tower
and now strange prophecies and sayings old
were everywhere rehearsed that from this hill
should come a king or savior of the world
even the poor dwellers in the distant plain
looked up they too had heard that hence should come
one quick to hear the poor and strong to save
and who shall dare to chide their simple faith
this humble reverence for the great unknown
brings men near god and opens unseen worlds
whence comes all life and where all power doth dwell
morning and evening on this tower the king
before the rising and the setting sun
blindly but in his father's faith bowed down
then he would rise and on his kingdom gaze
east west hills beyond hills stretched far away
wooded terraced or bleak and bald and bare
till in dim distance all were leveled lost
one rich and varied carpet spread far south
of fields of groves of busy cities wrought
with mighty rivers seeming silver threads
and to the north the himalayan chain
peak beyond peak a wall of crest and crag
ice bound snow capped backed by intensest blue
untrod immense that like a crystal wall
in myriad varied tints the glorious light
of rising and of setting sun reflects
his noble city lying at his feet
and his broad park tinged by the sun's slant rays
a thousand softly rich and varied shades
still on this scene of grandeur plenty peace
and ever varying beauty he would gaze
with sadness he had heard these prophecies
and felt the unrest in that great world within
hid from our blinded eyes yet ever near
the very soul and life of this dead world
which seers and prophets open eyed have seen
on which the dying often raptured gaze
and where they live when they are mourned as dead
this world was now astir foretelling day
a king shall come they say to rule the world
if he will rule but whence this mighty king
my years decline apace and yet no son
of mine to rule or light my funeral pile
one night queen maya sleeping by her lord
dreamed a strange dream she dreamed she saw a star
gliding from heaven and resting over her
she dreamed she heard strange music soft and sweet
so distant joy and peace was all she heard
in joy and peace she wakes and waits to know
what this strange dream might mean and whence it came
drums shells and trumpets sound for joy not war
the streets are swept and sprinkled with perfumes
and myriad lamps shine from each house and tree
and myriad flags flutter in every breeze
and children crowned with flowers dance in the streets
and all keep universal holiday
with shows and games and laugh and dance and song
for to the gentle queen a son is born
to king suddhodana the good an heir
but scarcely had these myriad lamps gone out
the sounds of revelry had scarcely died
when coming from the palace in hot haste
one cried maya the gentle queen is dead
then mirth was changed to sadness joy to grief
for all had learned to love the gentle queen
but at siddartha's birth this was foretold
among the strangers bringing gifts from far
there came an ancient sage whence no one knew
age bowed head like the snow eyes filmed and white
so deaf the thunder scarcely startled him
who met them as they said three journeys back
and all his talk was of a new born king
just born to rule the world if he would rule
he was so gentle seemed so wondrous wise
they followed him he following he said
a light they could not see and when encamped
morn noon and night devoutly would he pray
and then would talk for hours as friend to friend
with questionings about this new born king
gazing intently at the tent's blank wall
with nods and smiles as if he saw and heard
while they sit lost in wonder as one sits
who never saw a telephone but hears
unanswered questions laughter at unheard jests
and sees one bid a little box good by
and when they came before the king they saw
laughing and cooing on its mother's knee
picture of innocence a sweet young child
he saw a mighty prophet and bowed down
eight times in reverence to the very ground
and rising said thrice happy house all hail!
this child would rule the world if he would rule
but he too good to rule is born to save
but maya's work is done the devas wait
but when they sought for him the sage was gone
whence come or whither gone none ever knew
then gentle maya understood her dream
the music nearer clearer sounds she sleeps
but when the funeral pile was raised for her
of aloe sandal and all fragrant woods
and decked with flowers and rich with rare perfumes
and when the queen was gently laid thereon
as in sweet sleep and the pile set aflame
the king cried out in anguish when the sage
again appeared and gently said weep not!
seek not o king the living with the dead!
'tis but her cast off garment not herself
that now dissolves in air thy loved one lives
become thy deva who was erst thy queen
this said he vanished and was no more seen
now other hands take up that mother's task
another breast nurses that sweet young child
with growing love for who can nurse a child
feel its warm breath and little dimpled hands
kiss its soft lips look in its laughing eyes
hear its low cooing love notes soft and sweet
and not feel something of that miracle
a mother's love so old yet ever new
stronger than death bravest among the brave
gentle as brave watchful both night and day
that never changes never tires nor sleeps
whence comes this wondrous and undying love
whence can it come unless it comes from heaven
whose life is love eternal perfect love!
from babe to boy from boy to youth he grew
but more in grace and knowledge than in years
at play his joyous laugh rang loud and clear
his foot was fleetest in all boyish games
and strong his arm and steady nerve and eye
to whirl the quoit and send the arrow home
yet seeming oft to strive he'd check his speed
and miss his mark to let a comrade win
in fullness of young life he climbed the cliffs
where human foot had never trod before
he led the chase but when soft eyed gazelles
or bounding deer or any harmless thing
came in the range of his unerring dart
he let them pass for why thought he should men
in wantonness make war on innocence
one day the prince siddartha saw the grooms
gathered about a stallion snowy white
descended from that great nisaean stock
his fathers brought from iran's distant plain
named kantaka some held him fast with chains
till one could mount he like a lion snared
frantic with rage and fear did fiercely bound
they cut his tender mouth with bloody bit
beating his foaming sides until the prince
sterner than was his wont bade them desist
while he spoke soothingly patted his head
and stroked his neck and dropped those galling chains
when kantaka's fierce flaming eyes grew mild
he quiet stood by gentleness subdued
such mighty power hath gentleness and love
and from that day no horse so strong and fleet
so kind and true easy to check and guide
as kantaka siddartha's noble steed
to playmates he was gentle as a girl
yet should the strong presume upon their strength
to overbear or wrong those weaker than themselves
his sturdy arm and steady eye checked them
and he would gently say brother not so
our strength was given to aid and not oppress
for in an ancient book he found a truth
a book no longer read a truth forgot
entombed in iron castes and buried deep
in speculations and in subtle creeds
that men high low rich poor are brothers all
which pondered much in his heart's fruitful soil
had taken root as a great living truth
that to a mighty doctrine soon would grow
a mighty tree to heal the nations with its leaves
like some small grain of wheat appearing dead
in mummy case three thousand years ago
securely wrapped and sunk in egypt's tombs
themselves buried beneath the desert sands
which now brought forth and planted in fresh soil
and watered by the dews and rains of heaven
shoots up and yields a hundred fold of grain
until in golden harvests now it waves
on myriad acres many thousand miles
from where the single ancient seed had grown
thus he grew up with all that heart could wish
or power command his very life itself
so fresh and young sound body with sound mind
the living fountain of perpetual joy
yet he would often sit and sadly think
sad thoughts and deep and far beyond his years
how sorrow filled the world how things were shared
one born to waste another born to want
one for life's cream others to drain its dregs
one born a master others abject slaves
and when he asked his masters to explain
when all were brothers how such things could be
they gave him speculations fables old
how brahm first brahmans made to think for all
and then kshatriyas warriors from their birth
then sudras to draw water and hew wood
but why should one for others think when all
must answer for themselves why brothers fight
and why one born another's slave when all
might serve and help each other he would ask
but they could only answer never doubt
for so the holy brahmans always taught
still he must think and as he thought he sighed
not for his petty griefs that last an hour
but for the bitter sorrows of the world
that crush all men and last from age to age
the good old king saw this saw that the prince
the apple of his eye dearer than life
stately in form supple and strong in limb
quick to learn every art of peace and war
displaying and excelling every grace
and attribute of his most royal line
whom all would follow whereso'er he led
so fit to rule the world if he would rule
thought less of ruling than of saving men
he saw the glory of his ancient house
suspended on an if if he will rule
the empire of the world and power to crush
those cruel bloody kings who curse mankind
and power to make a universal peace
if not this high career with glory crowned
then seeking truth through folly's devious ways
by self inflicted torture seeking bliss
and by self murder seeking higher life
on one foot standing till the other pine
arms stretched aloft fingers grown bloodless claws
or else impaled on spikes with festering sores
covered from head to foot the body wastes
with constant anguish and with slow decay
can this be wisdom can such a life be good
that shuns all duties lying in our path
useless to others filled with grief and pain
not so my father's god teaches to live
rising each morning most exact in time
he bathes the earth and sky with rosy light
and fills all nature with new life and joy
the cock's shrill clarion calls us to awake
and breathe this life and hear the bursts of song
that fill each grove inhale the rich perfume
of opening flowers and work while day shall last
then rising higher he warms each dank cold spot
dispels the sickening vapors clothes the fields
with waving grain the trees with golden fruit
the vines with grapes and when 'tis time for rest
sinks in the west and with new glory gilds
the mountain tops the clouds and western sky
and calls all nature to refreshing sleep
if he be god the useful are like god
if not god made the sun who made all men
and by his great example teaches them
the diligent are wise the useful good
sorely perplexed he called his counselors
grown gray in serving their beloved king
and said friends of my youth manhood and age
so wise in counsel and so brave in war
who never failed in danger or distress
oppressed with fear I come to you for aid
you know the prophecies that from my house
shall come a king or savior of the world
you saw strange signs precede siddartha's birth
and saw the ancient sage whom no one knew
fall down before the prince and hail my house
you heard him tell the queen she soon would die
and saw her sink in death as in sweet sleep
you laid her gently on her funeral pile
and heard my cry of anguish when the sage
again appeared and bade me not to weep
for her as dead who lived and loved me still
we saw the prince grow up to man's estate
so strong and full of manliness and grace
and wise beyond his teachers and his years
and thought in him the prophecies fulfilled
and that with glory he would rule the world
and bless all men with universal peace
but now dark shadows fall athwart our hopes
often in sleep the prince will start and cry
as if in pain 'o world sad world I come!'
but roused he'll sometimes sit the livelong day
forgetting teachers sports and even food
as if with dreadful visions overwhelmed
or buried in great thoughts profound and deep
but yet to see our people riding forth
to their acclaims he answers with such grace
and gentle stateliness my heart would swell
as I would hear the people to each other say
'who ever saw such grace and grandeur joined'
yet while he answers gladness with like joy
his eyes seem searching for the sick and old
the poor and maimed and blind all forms of grief
and oft he'd say tears streaming from his eyes
'let us return my heart can bear no more'
one day we saw beneath a peepul tree
an aged brahman wasted with long fasts
loathsome with self inflicted ghastly wounds
a rigid skeleton standing erect
one hand stretched out the other stretched aloft
his long white beard grown filthy by neglect
whereat the prince with shuddering horror shook
and cried 'o world! must I be such for thee'
and once he led the chase of a wild boar
in the great forest near the glacier's foot
on kantaka so fleet he soon outstripped
the rest and in the distance disappeared
but when at night they reached the rendezvous
siddartha was not there and through the night
they searched fearing to find their much loved prince
a mangled corpse under some towering cliff
but searched in vain and searched again next day
till in despair they thought to bring me word
the prince was lost when kantaka was seen
loose reined and free and near siddartha sat
under a giant cedar's spreading shade
absorbed in thought in contemplation lost
unconscious that a day and night had passed
I cannot reason with such earnestness
I dare not chide such deep and tender love
but much I fear his reason's overthrow
or that he may become like that recluse
he shuddered at and not a mighty king
with power to crush the wrong and aid the right
how can we turn his mind from such sad thoughts
to life's full joys the duties of a king
and his great destiny so long foretold
the oldest and the wisest answered him
most noble king your thoughts have long been mine
oft have I seen him lost in musings sad
and overwhelmed with this absorbing love
I know no cure for such corroding thoughts
but thoughts less sad for such absorbing love
but stronger love
but how awake such thoughts
the king replied how kindle such a love
his loves seem but as phosphorescent flames
that skim the surface leaving him heart whole
all but this deep and all embracing love
that folds within its arms a suffering world
yes noble king so roams the antlered deer
adding each year a branch to his great horns
until the unseen archer lays him low
so lives our prince but he may see the day
two laughing eyes shall pierce his inmost soul
and make his whole frame quiver with new fire
the next full moon he reaches man's estate
we all remember fifty years ago
when you became a man the sports and games
the contests of fair women and brave men
in beauty arts and arms that filled three days
with joy and gladness music dance and song
let us with double splendor now repeat
that festival with prizes that shall draw
from all your kingdom and the neighbor states
their fairest women and their bravest men
if any chance shall bring his destined mate
you then shall see love dart from eye to eye
as darts the lightning's flash from cloud to cloud
and this seemed good and so was ordered done
the king to all his kingdom couriers sent
and to the neighbor states inviting all
to a great festival and royal games
the next full moon day of siddartha's birth
and offering varied prizes rich and rare
to all in feats of strength and speed and skill
and prizes doubly rich and doubly rare
to all such maidens fair as should compete
in youth and beauty whencesoe'er they came
the prince to be the judge and give the prize
now all was joy and bustle in the streets
and joy and stir in palace and in park
the prince himself joining the joyful throng
forgetting now the sorrows of the world
devising and directing new delights
until the park became a fairy scene
behind the palace lay a maidan wide
for exercise in arms and manly sports
its sides bordered by gently rising hills
where at their ease the city's myriads sat
under the shade of high pruned spreading trees
fanned by cool breezes from the snow capped peaks
while north and next the lake a stately dome
stood out on slender graceful columns raised
with seats rank above rank in order placed
the throne above and near the throne were bowers
of slender lattice work with trailing vines
thick set with flowers of every varied tint
breathing perfumes where beauty's champions
might sit unseen of all yet seeing all
at length siddartha's natal day arrives
with joy to rich and poor to old and young  
not joy that wealth can buy or power command
but real joy that springs from real love
love to the good old king and noble prince
when dawning day tinges with rosy light
the snow capped peaks of himalaya's chain
the people are astir in social groups
the old and young companions neighbors friends
baskets well filled they choose each vantage ground
until each hill a sea of faces shows
a sea of sparkling joy and rippling mirth
at trumpet sound all eyes are eager turned
up toward the palace gates now open wide
from whence a gay procession issues forth
a chorus of musicians coming first
and next the prince mounted on kantaka
then all the high born youth in rich attire
mounted on prancing steeds with trappings gay
and then the good old king in royal state
on his huge elephant white as the snow
surrounded by his aged counselors
some on their chargers some in litters borne
their long white beards floating in every breeze
and next competitors for every prize
twelve archers who could pierce the lofty swans
sailing from feeding grounds by distant seas
to summer nests by thibet's marshy lakes
or hit the whirring pheasant as it flies
for in this peaceful reign they did not make
men targets for their art and armor joints
the marks through which to pierce and kill
then wrestlers boxers those who hurl the quoit
and runners fleet both lithe and light of limb
and then twelve mighty spearmen who could pierce
the fleeing boar or deer or fleet gazelle
then chariots three horses yoked to each
the charioteers in persian tunics clad
arms bare legs bare all were athletes in power
in form and race each an apollo seemed
yoked to the first were three nisaean steeds
each snowy white proud stepping rangy tall
chests broad legs clean and strong necks arched and high
with foreheads broad and eyes large full and mild
a race that oft olympic prizes won
and whose descendants far from iran's plains
bore armored knights in battle's deadly shock
on many bloody european fields
then three of ancient babylonian stock
blood bay and glossy as rich tyrian silk
such horses israel's sacred prophets saw
bearing their conquerors in triumph home
a race for ages kept distinct and pure
fabled from alexander's charger sprung
then three from distant desert tartar steppes
ewe necked ill favored creatures lank and gaunt
that made the people laugh as they passed by
who ceased to laugh when they had run the race
such horses bore the mighty mongol hosts
that with the cyclone's speed swept o'er the earth
then three one gray one bay one glossy black
descended from four horses long since brought
by love sick chief from araby the blest
seeking with such rare gifts an indian bride
whose slender graceful forms compact and light
combined endurance beauty strength and speed
a wondrous breed whose famed descendants bore
the moslem hosts that swept from off the earth
thy mighty power corrupt declining rome
and with each other now alone contend
in speed whose sons cast out abused and starved
alone can save from raging whirlwind flames
that all devouring sweep our western plains
then stately elephants came next in line
with measured step and gently swaying gait
covered with cloth of gold richly inwrought
each bearing in a howdah gaily decked
a fair competitor for beauty's prize
with merry comrades and some sober friend
the vina bansuli sitar and harp
filling the air with sweetest melody
while rippling laughter from each howdah rang
and sweetest odors as from op'ning flowers
breathed from their rich apparel as they passed
and thus they circle round the maidan wide
and as they pass along the people shout
long live the king! long live our noble prince!
to all which glad acclaims the prince responds
with heartfelt courtesy and royal grace
when they had nearly reached the palace gate
on their return the king drew to the right
with his attendants while the prince with his
drew to the left reviewing all the line
that passed again down to the judges' seat
under the king's pavilion near the lake
the prince eagerly watched them as they passed
noting their brawny limbs and polished arms
the pose and skill of every charioteer
the parts and varied breed of every horse
aiding his comrades with his deeper skill
but when the queens of beauty passed him by
he was all smiles and gallantry and grace
until the last yasodhara came near
whose laugh was clearest of the merry crowd
whose golden hair imprisoned sunlight seemed
whose cheek blending the lily with the rose
spoke of more northern skies and aryan blood
whose rich not gaudy robes exquisite taste
had made to suit her so they seemed a part
of her sweet self whose manner simple free
not bold or shy whose features no one saw
her features for her soul covered her face
as with a veil of ever moving life
when she came near and her bright eyes met his
he seemed to start his gallantry was gone
and like an awkward boy he sat and gazed
and her laugh too was hushed and she passed on
passed out of sight but never out of mind
the king and all his counselors saw this
good king our deer is struck asita said
if this love cure him not nothing can cure
she passed along and then the king and prince
with their attendants wheeled in line and moved
down to the royal stand each to his place
the trumpets sound and now the games begin
but see the scornful curl of culture's lip
at such low sports! dyspeptic preachers hear
harangue the sleepers on their sinfulness!
hear grave philosophers so limp and frail
they scarce can walk god's earth to breathe his air
talk of the waste of time! short sighted men!
god made the body just to fit the mind
each part exact no scrimping and no waste
neglect the body and you cramp the soul
first brawny wrestlers shining from the bath
wary and watchful quick with arm and eye
after long play clinch close arms twined knees locked
each nerve and muscle strained and stand as still
as if a bronze from vulcan's fabled shop
or else by power of magic changed to stone
in that supremest moment when a breath
or feather's weight would tip the balanced scale
and when they fall the shouts from hill to hill
sound like the voices of the mighty deep
as wave on wave breaks on the rock bound shore
then boxers eye to eye and foot to foot
one arm at guard the other raised to strike
the hurlers of the quoit next stand in line
measure the distance with experienced eye
adjust the rings swing them with growing speed
until at length on very tiptoe poised
like mercury just lighted on the earth
with mighty force they whirl them through the air
and then the spearmen having for a mark
a lion rampant standing as in life
so distant that it seemed but half life size
each vital part marked with a little ring
and when the spears were hurled six trembling stood
fixed in the beast piercing each vital part
leaving the victory in even scale
for these was set far off a lesser mark
until at length by chance not lack of skill
the victory so long in doubt was won
and then again the people wildly shout
the prince victor and nobly vanquished praised
next runners lithe and light glide round the plain
whose flying feet like mercury's seemed winged
their chests expanded and their swinging arms
like oars to guide and speed their rapid course
and as they passed along the people cheered
each well known master of the manly art
then archers with broad chests and brawny arms
such as the blacksmith's heavy hammer wields
with quick hard blows that make the anvil ring
and myriad sparks from the hot iron fly
a golden eagle on a screen their mark
so distant that it seemed a sparrow's size
for said the prince let not this joyful day
give anguish to the smallest living thing
they strain their bows until their muscles seem
like knotted cords the twelve strings twang at once
and the ground trembles as at the swelling tones
of mighty organs or the thunder's roll
two arrows pierce the eagle while the rest
all pierce the screen a second mark was set
when lo! high up in air two lines of swans
having one leader seek their northern nests
their white plumes shining in the noonday sun
calling each other in soft mellow notes
instant one of the people cries a mark!
whereat the thousands shout a mark! a mark!
one of the archers chose the leader one the last
their arrows fly the last swan left its mates
as if sore wounded while the first came down
like a great eagle swooping for its prey
and fell before the prince its strong wing pierced
its bright plumes darkened by its crimson blood
whereat the people shout and shout again
until the hills repeat the mighty sound
the prince gently but sadly raised the bird
stroked tenderly its plumes calmed its wild fear
and gave to one to care for and to cure
and now the people for the chariot race
grow eager while beneath the royal stand
by folding doors hid from the public view
the steeds harnessed and ready champ their bits
and paw the ground impatient for the start
the charioteers alert with one strong hand
hold high the reins the other holds the lash
timour a name that since has filled the world
a tartar chief whose sons long after swept
as with destruction's broom fair india's plains
with northern jargon calmed his eager steeds
azim from cashmere's rugged lovely vale
his prancing babylonians firmly held
channa from ganges' broad and sacred stream
with bit and word checked his nisaean three
while devadatta cousin to the prince
soothed his impatient arabs with such terms
as fondest mothers to their children use
atair my pet! mira my baby hush!
regil my darling child be still! be still!
with necks high arched nostrils distended wide
and eager gaze they stood as those that saw
some distant object in their desert home
at length the gates open as of themselves
when at the trumpet's sound the steeds dash forth
as by one spirit moved under tight rein
and neck and neck they thunder down the plain
while rising dust clouds chase the flying wheels
but weight not lack of nerve or spirit tells
azim and channa urge their steeds in vain
by tartar and light arab left behind
as the light galley leaves the man of war
they sweat and labor ere a mile is gained
while their light rivals pass the royal stand
fresh as at first just warming to the race
and now the real race at length begins
a double race such as the romans loved
horses so matched in weight and strength and speed
drivers so matched in skill that as they pass
azim and channa seemed a single man
timour and devadatta side by side
wheel almost touching wheel dash far ahead
azim and channa left so far behind
no longer urge a race already lost
the babylonian and nisaean steeds
no longer pressed so far beyond their power
with long and even strides sweep smoothly on
striking the earth as with a single blow
their hot breath rising in a single cloud
arab and tartar with a longer stride
and lighter stroke skim lightly o'er the ground
watching the horses with a master's eye
as devadatta and timour four times
azim and channa thrice swept by the stand
the prince saw that another round would test
not overtax their powers and gave the sign
when three loud trumpet blasts to all proclaimed
that running one more round would end the race
these ringing trumpet calls that brought defeat
or victory so near startle and rouse
the charioteers more ardent urge their steeds
the steeds are with hot emulation fired
the social multitude now cease to talk
even age stops short in stories often told
boys downy chinned in rough and tumble sports
like half grown bears engaged turn quick and look
and blooming girls with merry ringing laugh
romping in gentler games watching meanwhile
with sly and sidelong look the rougher sports
turn eagerly to see the scene below
while mothers for the time forget their babes
and lovers who had sought out quiet nooks
to tell the tale that all the past has told
and coming times will tell stand mute and gaze
the home stretch soon is reached and channa's three
by word and lash urged to their topmost speed
the foaming babylonians left behind
while devadatta and timour draw near
a whole round gained timour a length ahead
but devadatta loosens now his reins
chides his fleet pets with lash swung high in air
wounds their proud spirits not their tender flesh
with lion bounds they pass the tartar steeds
that with hot rival rage and open mouths
and flaming eyes and fierce and angry cries
dash full at regil's side but dash in vain
fear adding speed the arabs sweep ahead
meanwhile the prince springs forward from his seat
and all on tiptoe still and eager stand
so that the rumbling of the chariot wheels
the tramp of flying feet and drivers' cries
alone the universal stillness break
as when before the bursting of some fearful storm
birds beasts and men stand mute with trembling awe
while heaven's artillery and roaring winds
are in the awful silence only heard
but when the double victory is gained
drums shells and trumpets mingle with the shouts
from hill to hill re echoed and renewed
as when after the morning's threatening bow
dark lurid whirling clouds obscure the day
and forked lightnings dart athwart the sky
and angry winds roll up the boiling sea
and thunder raging winds and warring waves
join in one mighty and earth shaking roar
thus end the games and the procession forms
the king and elders first contestants next
and last the prince each victor laurel crowned
and after each his prize while all were given
some choice memorial of the happy day
cinctures to all athletes to gird the loins
and falling just below the knee the belt
of stoutest leather joined with silver clasps
the skirt of softest wool or finest silk
adorned with needlework and decked with gems
such as the modest aryans always wore
in games intended for the public view
before the greeks became degenerate
and savage rome compelled those noble men
whose only crime was love of liberty
by discipline and numbers overwhelmed
bravely defending children wife and home
naked to fight each other or wild beasts
and called this brutal savagery high sport
for them and for their proud degenerate dames
of whom few were what caesar's wife should be
the athletes' prizes all were rich and rare
some costly emblem of their several arts
the archers' prizes all were bows the first
made from the horns of a great mountain goat
that long had ranged the himalayan heights
till some bold hunter climbed his giddy cliffs
and brought his unsuspecting victim down
his lofty horns the bowsmith root to root
had firmly joined and polished bright
and tipped with finest gold and made a bow
worthy of sinhahamu's mighty arm
the other prizes bows of lesser strength
but better suited to their weaker arms
a chariot the charioteers' first prize
its slender hubs made strong with brazen bands
the spokes of whitest ivory polished bright
the fellies ebony with tires of bronze
each axle's end a brazen tiger's head
the body woven of slender bamboo shoots
intwined with silver wire and decked with gold
a mare and colt of the victorious breed
the second prize more worth in timour's eyes
than forty chariots though each were made
of ebony or ivory or gold
and all the laurel india ever grew
the third a tunic of soft cashmere wool
on which by skillful needles deftly wrought
the race itself as if in life stood forth
the fourth a belt to gird the laggard's loins
and whip to stimulate his laggard steeds
and thus arrayed they moved once round the course
then to the palace as a fitter place
for beauty's contest than the open plain
the singers chanting a triumphal hymn
while many instruments deep toned and shrill
and all the multitude the chorus swell
this day his mission ceased to press the prince
and he forgot the sorrows of the world
so deep and earnest seemed the general joy
even those with grinning skeletons at home
in secret closets locked from public view
and care and sorrow rankling at their hearts
joined in the general laugh and swelled the shouts
and seemed full happy though they only seemed
but through the games while all was noisy mirth
he felt a new strange feeling at his heart
and ever and anon he stole a glance
at beauty's rose embowered hiding place
to catch a glimpse of those two laughing eyes
so penetrating yet so soft and mild
and at the royal banquet spread for all
it chanced yasodhara sat next the prince
an accident by older heads designed
and the few words that such constraint allowed
were music to his ears and touched his heart
and when her eyes met his her rosy blush
told what her maiden modesty would hide
and at the dance when her soft hands touched his
the music seemed to quicken time to speed
but when she bowed and passed to other hands
winding the mystic measure of the dance
the music seemed to slacken time to halt
or drag his limping moments lingering on
at length after the dance the beauties passed
before the prince and each received her prize
so rich and rare that each thought hers the first
a treasure to be kept and shown with pride
and handed down to children yet unborn
but when yasodhara before him stood
the prizes all were gone but from his neck
he took a golden chain thick set with gems
and clasped it round her slender waist and said
take this and keep it for the giver's sake
and from the prince they passed before the king
the proud and stately he would greet with grace
the timid cheer with kind and gracious words
but when yasodhara bowed low and passed
he started and his color went and came
as if oppressed with sudden inward pain
asita oldest of his counselors
sprang to his side and asked what ails the king
nothing my friend nothing the king replied
but the sharp probing of an ancient wound
you know how my sweet queen was loved of all
but how her life was woven into mine
filling my inmost soul none e'er can know
my bitter anguish words can never tell
as that sweet life was gently breathed away
time only strengthens this enduring love
and she seems nearer me as I grow old
often in stillest night's most silent hour
when the sly nibbling of a timid mouse
in the deep stillness sounds almost as loud
as builders' hammers in the busy day
my maya as in life stands by my side
a halo round her head as she would say
'a little while and you shall have your own'
often in deepest sleep she seems to steal
into that inmost chamber of my soul
vacant for her and nestle to my heart
breathing a peace my waking hours know not
and when I wake and turn to clasp my love
my sinking heart finds but her vacant place
since that sad day that stole her from my arms
I've seen a generation of sweet girls
grow up to womanhood but none like her!
hut that bright vision that just flitted by
seemed so like her it made me cringe and start
o dear asita little worth is life
with all its tears and partings woes and pains
if when its short and fitful fever ends
there is no after life where death and pain
and sundered ties and crushed and bleeding hearts
and sad and last farewells are never known
such was the old and such the new born love
the new quick bursting into sudden flame
warming the soul to active consciousness
that man alone is but a severed part
of one full rounded perfect living whole
the old a steady but undying flame
a living longing for the loved and lost
but each a real hunger of the soul
for what gave paradise its highest bliss
and what in this poor fallen world of ours
gives glimpses of its high and happy life
o love! how beautiful! how pure! how sweet!
life of the angels that surround god's throne!
but when corrupt pandora's box itself
whence spring all human ills and woes and crimes
the very fire that lights the flames of hell
the festival is past the crowds have gone
the diligent to their accustomed round
of works and days works to each day assigned
the thoughtless and the thriftless multitude
to meet their tasks haphazard as they come
but all the same old story to repeat
of cares and sorrows sweetened by some joys
three days the sweet yasodhara remained
for her long journey taking needful rest
but when the rosy dawn next tinged the east
and lit the mountain tops and filled the park
with a great burst of rich and varied song
the good old king bade the sweet girl farewell
imprinting on her brow a loving kiss
while welling up from tender memories
big tear drops trickled down his furrowed cheeks
and as her train escorted by the prince
and noble youth wound slowly down the hill
the rising sun with glory gilds the city
that like a diadem circled its brow
while giant shadows stretch across the plain
and when they reach the plain they halt for rest
deep in a garden's cooling shade where flowers
that fill the air with grateful fragrance hang
by ripening fruits and where all seems at rest
save two young hearts and tiny tireless birds
that dart from flower to newer to suck their sweets
and even the brook that babbled down the hill
now murmurs dreamily as if asleep
sweet spot! sweet hour! how quick its moments fly!
how soon the cooling winds and sinking sun
and bustling stir of preparation tells
'tis time for her to go and when they part
the gentle pressure of the hand one kiss
a kiss not given yet not resisted tells
a tale of love that words are poor to tell
and when she goes how lonely seems her way
through groves through fields through busy haunts of men
and as he climbs the hill and often stops
to watch her lessening train until at length
her elephant seems but a moving speck
proud kantaka pawing and neighing asks
as plain as men could ever ask in words
what makes my master choose this laggard pace
at length she climbs those rocky rugged hills
that guarded well the loveliest spot on earth
until the moguls centuries after came
like swarms of locusts swept before the wind
or ravening wolves to conquer fair cashmere
and when she reached the top before her lay
as on a map spread out her native land
by lofty mountains walled on every side
from winds from wars and from the world shut out
the same great snow capped mountains north and east
in silent glittering awful grandeur stand
and west the same bold rugged cliff crowned hills
that filled her eyes with wonder when a child
below the snow a belt of deepest green
below this belt of green great rolling hills
checkered with orchards vineyards pastures fields
the vale beneath peaceful as sleeping babe
the city nestling round the shining lake
and near the park and palace her sweet home
o noble peaceful beautiful cashmere!
well named the garden of eternal spring!
but yet with home and all its joys so near
she often turned and strained her eager eyes
to catch one parting glimpse of that sweet spot
where more than half of her young heart was left
at length their horns whose mocking echoes
rolled from hill to hill were answered from below
while from the park a gay procession comes
increasing as it moves to welcome her
light of the palace the people's idol home
the prince's thoughts by day and dreams by night
meanwhile were filled with sweet yasodhara
and this bright vision ever hovering near
hid from his eyes those grim and ghastly forms
night loving and light shunning brood of sin
that ever haunt poor fallen human lives
and from the darkened corners of the soul
are quick to sting each pleasure with sharp pain
to pour some bitter in life's sweetest cup
and shadow with despair its brightest hopes
made him forget how sorrow fills the world
how strength is used to crush and not to raise
how creeds are bandages to blind men's eyes
lest they should see and walk in duty's path
that leads to peace on earth and joy in heaven
and even made him for the time forget
his noble mission to restore and save
he sought her for his bride but waited long
for princes cannot wed like common folk
friends called a feast prepared some bridal gifts
some tears at parting and some solemn vows
rice scattered slippers thrown with noisy mirth
and common folk are joined till death shall part
till death shall part! o faithless cruel thought!
death ne'er shall part souls joined by holy love
who through life's trials joys and cares
have to each other clung faithful till death
tender and true in sickness and in health
bearing each other's burdens sharing griefs
lightening each care and heightening every joy
such life is but a transient honeymoon
a feeble foretaste of eternal joys
but princes when they love though all approve
must wait on councils embassies and forms
but how the coach of state lumbers and lags
with messages of love whose own light wings
glide through all bars outstrip all fleetest things
no bird so light no thought so fleet as they
but while the prince chafed at the long delay
the sweet yasodhara began to feel
the bitter pangs of unrequited love
but her young hands busy with others' wants
and her young heart busy with others' woes
with acts of kindness filled the lagging hours
best of all medicines for aching hearts
yet often she would seek a quiet nook
deep in the park where giant trees cross arms
making high gothic arches and a shade
that noonday's fiercest rays could scarcely pierce
and there alone with her sad heart communed
yes! I have kept it for the giver's sake
but he has quite forgot his love his gift and me
how bright these jewels seemed warmed by his love
but now how dull how icy and how dead!
but soon the soft eyed antelopes and fawns
and fleet gazelles came near and licked her hands
and birds of every rich and varied plume
gathered around and filled the air with song
and even timid pheasants brought their broods
for her sweet loving life had here restored
the peace and harmony of paradise
and as they shared her bounty she was soothed
by their mute confidence and perfect trust
but though time seems to lag yet still it moves
resistless as the ocean's swelling tide
bearing its mighty freight of human lives
with all their joys and sorrows hopes and fears
onward forever onward to life's goal
at length the embassy is sent and now
just as the last faint rays of rosy light
fade from the topmost himalayan peaks
and tired nature sinks to quiet rest
a horseman dashes through the silent streets
bearing the waiting prince the welcome word
that one short journey of a single day
divides him from the sweet yasodhara
and light winged rumor spreads the joyful news
and ere the dawn had danced from mountain top
o'er hill and vale and plain to the sweet notes
of nature's rich and varied orchestra
and dried the pearly tears that night had wept
the prince led forth his train to meet his bride
wondering that kantaka always so free
so eager and so fleet should seem to lag
and in that fragrant garden's cooling shade
where they had parted now again they meet
and there we leave them reverently alone
for art can never paint nor words describe
the peace and rest and rapture of that scene
meanwhile the city rings with busy stir
the streets are swept and sprinkled with perfumes
and when the evening shades had veiled the earth
and heaven's blue vault was set with myriad stars
the promised signal from the watchtower sounds
and myriad lamps shine from each house and tree
and merry children strew their way with flowers
and all come forth to greet siddartha's bride
and welcome her their second maya home
and at the palace gate the good old king
receives her with such loving tenderness
as fondest mother sick with hope deferred
waiting and watching for an absent child
at length receives him in her open arms

and now his cup with every blessing filled
full to the brim to overflowing full
what more has life to give or heart to wish
stately in form with every princely grace
a very master of all manly arts
his gentle manners making all his friends
his young blood bounding on in healthful flow
his broad domains rich in all earth can yield
guarded by nature and his people's love
and now that deepest of all wants supplied
the want of one to share each inmost thought
whose sympathy can soothe each inmost smart
whose presence care and loving touch can make
the palace or the humblest cottage home
his life seemed rounded perfect full complete
and they were happy as the days glide on
and when at night locked in each other's arms
they sink to rest heart beating close to heart
their thoughts all innocence and trust and love
it almost seemed as if remorseless time
had backward rolled his tide and brought again
the golden age with all its peace and joy
and our first parents ere the tempter came
were taking sweet repose in paradise
but as one night they slept a troubled dream
disturbed the prince he dreamed he saw one come
as young and fair as sweet yasodhara
but clad in widow's weeds and in her arms
a lifeless child crying most mighty prince!
o bring me back my husband and my child!
but he could only say alas! poor soul!
and started out of sleep he cried alas!
which waked the sweet yasodhara who asked
what ails my love only a troubled dream
the prince replied but still she felt him tremble
and kissed and stroked his troubled brow
and soothed him into quiet sleep again
and then once more he dreamed a pleasing dream
he dreamed he heard strange music soft and sweet
he only caught its burden peace be still!
and then he thought he saw far off a light
and there a place where all was peace and rest
and waking sighed to find it all a dream
one day this happy couple side by side
rode forth alone yasodhara unveiled
for why said she should those whose thoughts are pure
like guilty things hide from their fellow men
rode through the crowded streets their only guard
the people's love strongest and best of guards
for many arms would spring to their defense
while some grim tyrant at whose stern command
a million swords would from their scabbards leap
cringes in terror behind bolts and bars
starts at each sound and fears some hidden mine
may into atoms blow his stately towers
or that some hand unseen may strike him down
and thinks that poison lurks in every cup
while thousands are in loathsome dungeons thrust
or pine in exile for a look or word
and as they pass along from street to street
a sea of happy faces lines their way
their joyful greetings answered by the prince
no face once seen no name once heard forgot
while sweet yasodhara was wreathed in smiles
the kind expression of her gentle heart
when from a little cottage by the way
the people making room for him to pass
there came an aged man so very old
that time had ceased to register his years
his step was firm his eye though faded mild
and childhood's sweet expression on his face
the prince stopped short before him bending low
and gently asked what would my father have
speak freely what I can I freely give
most noble prince I need no charity
for my kind neighbors give me all unasked
and my poor cottage where my fathers dwelt
and where my children and their mother died
is kept as clean as when sweet gunga lived
and young and old cheer up my lonely hours
and ask me much of other times and men
for when your father's father was a child
I was a man as young and strong as you
and my sweet gunga your companion's age
but o the mystery of life explain!
why are we born to tread this little round
to live to love to suffer sorrow die
why do the young like field flowers bloom to fade
why are the strong like the mown grass cut down
why am I left as if by death forgot
left here alone a leafless fruitless trunk
is death the end or what comes after death
often when deepest sleep shuts out the world
the dead still seem to live while life fades out
and when I sit alone and long for light
the veil seems lifted and I seem to see
a world of life and light and peace and rest
no sickness sin or sorrow pain or death
no helpless infancy or hopeless age
but we poor sudras cannot understand
yet from my earliest memory I've heard
that from this hill one day should burst a light
not for the brahmans only but for all
and when you were a child I saw a sage
bow down before you calling you that light
o noble mighty prince! let your light shine
that men no longer grope in dark despair!
he spoke and sank exhausted on the ground
they gently raised him but his life was fled
the prince gave one a well filled purse and said
let his pile neither lack for sandal wood
or any emblem of a life well spent
and when fit time had passed they bore him thence
and laid him on that couch where all sleep well
half hid in flowers by loving children brought
a smile still lingering on his still cold lips
as if they just had tasted gunga's kiss
soon to be kissed by eager whirling flames
just then two stately brahmans proudly passed
passed on the other side gathering their robes
to shun pollution from the common touch
and passing said the prince with sudras talks
as friend to friend but wisdom comes with years
silent and thoughtful then they homeward turned
the prince deep musing on the old man's words
'the veil is lifted and I seem to see
a world of life and light and peace and rest'
o if that veil would only lift for me
the mystery of life would be explained
as they passed on through unfrequented streets
seeking to shun the busy thoughtless throng
those other words like duty's bugle call
still ringing in his ears let your light shine
that men no longer grope in dark despair
the old sad thoughts long checked by passing joys
rolling and surging swept his troubled soul
as pent up waters having burst their dams
sweep down the valleys and o'erwhelm the plains
just then an aged angry voice cried out
o help! they've stolen my jewels and my gold!
and from a wretched hovel by the way
an old man came hated and shunned by all
whose life was spent in hoarding unused gold
grinding the poor devouring widows' homes
ill fed ill clad from eagerness to save
his sunken eyes glittering with rage and greed
and when the prince enquired what troubled him
trouble enough he said my sons have fled
because I would not waste in dainty fare
and rich apparel all my life has saved
and taken all my jewels all my gold
would that they both lay dead before my face!
o precious jewels! o beloved gold!
the prince helpless to soothe hopeless to cure
this rust and canker of the soul passed on
his heart with all embracing pity filled
o deepening mystery of life! he cried
why do such souls in human bodies dwell
fitter for ravening wolves or greedy swine!
just at death's door cursing his flesh and blood
for thievish greed inherited from him
is this old age or swinish greed grown old
o how unlike that other life just fled!
his youth's companions wife and children dead
yet filled with love for all by all beloved
with his whole heart yearning for others' good
with his last breath bewailing others' woes
my best beloved said sweet yasodhara
her bright eyes filled with sympathetic tears
her whole soul yearning for his inward peace
brood not too much on life's dark mystery
behind the darkest clouds the sun still shines
but said the prince the many blindly grope
in sorrow fear and ignorance profound
while their proud teachers with their heads erect
stalk boldly on blind leaders of the blind
come care come fasting woe and pain for me
and even exile from my own sweet home
all would I welcome could I give them light
but would you leave your home leave me leave all
and even leave our unborn pledge of love
the living blending of our inmost souls
that now within me stirs to bid you pause
only for love of you and him and all!
o hard necessity! o bitter cup!
but would you have me like a coward shun
the path of duty though beset with thorns
thorns that must pierce your tender feet and mine
piercing the question as the sharpest sword
their love their joys tempted to say him nay
but soon she conquered all and calmly said
my love my life where duty plainly calls
I bid you go though my poor heart must bleed
and though my eyes weep bitter scalding tears
their hearts too full for words too full for tears
gently he pressed her hand and they passed home
and in the presence of this dark unknown
a deep and all pervading tenderness
guides every act and tempers every tone
as in the chamber of the sick and loved
the step is light the voice is soft and low
but soon their days with varied duties filled
their nights with sweet repose glide smoothly on
until this shadow seems to lift and fade
as when the sun bursts through the passing storm
gilding the glittering raindrops as they fall
and paints the bow of hope on passing clouds
yet still the old sad thoughts sometimes return
the burden of a duty unperformed
the earnest yearning for a clearer light
the thought that hour by hour and day by day
the helpless multitudes grope blindly on
clouded his joys and often banished sleep
one day in this sad mood he thought to see
his people as they are in daily life
and not in holiday attire to meet their prince
in merchant's dress his charioteer his clerk
the prince and channa passed unknown and saw
the crowded streets alive with busy hum
traders cross legged with their varied wares
the wordy war to cheapen or enhance
one rushing on to clear the streets for wains
with huge stone wheels by slow strong oxen drawn
palanquin bearers droning out hu hu ho ho
while keeping step and praising him they bear
the housewives from the fountain water bring
in balanced water jars their black eyed babes
athwart their hips their busy tongues meanwhile
engaged in gossip of the little things
that make the daily round of life to them
the skillful weaver at his clumsy loom
the miller at his millstones grinding meal
the armorer linking his shirts of mail
the money changer at his heartless trade
the gaping eager crowd gathered to watch
snake charmers that can make their deadly charge
dance harmless to the drone of beaded gourds
sword players keeping many knives in air
jugglers and those that dance on ropes swung high
and all this varied work and busy idleness
as in a panorama passing by
while they were passing through these varied scenes
the prince whose ears were tuned to life's sad notes
whose eyes were quick to catch its deepest shades
found sorrow pain and want disease and death
were woven in its very warp and woof
a tiger springing from a sheltering bush
had snatched a merchant's comrade from his side
a deadly cobra hidden by the path
had stung to death a widow's only son
a breath of jungle wind a youth's blood chilled
or filled a strong man's bones with piercing pain
a household widowed by a careless step
the quick cross lightning from an angry cloud
struck down a bridegroom bringing home his bride
all this and more he heard and much he saw
a young man stricken in life's early prime
shuffled along dragging one palsied limb
while one limp arm hung useless by his side
a dwarf sold little knickknacks by the way
his body scarcely in the human form
to which long arms and legs seemed loosely hung
his noble head thrust forward on his breast
whose pale sad face as plainly told as words
that life had neither health nor hope for him
an old man tottering from a hovel came
frail haggard palsied leaning on a staff
whose eyes dull glazed and meaningless proclaim
the body lingers when the mind has fled
one seized with sudden hot distemper of the blood
writhing with anguish by the wayside sunk
the purple plague spot on his pallid cheek
cold drops of perspiration on his brow
with wildly rolling eyes and livid lips
gasping for breath and feebly asking help
but ere the prince could aid death gave relief
at length they passed the city's outer gate
and down a stream now spread in shining pools
now leaping in cascades now dashing on
a line of foam along its rocky bed
bordered by giant trees with densest shade
here day by day the city bring their dead
here day by day they build the funeral piles
here lamentations daily fill the air
here hissing flames each day taste human flesh
and friendly watchmen guard the smoldering pile
till friends can cull the relics from the dust
and here just finished rose a noble pile
by stately brahmans for a brahman built
of fragrant woods and drenched with fragrant oils
loading the air with every sweet perfume
that india's forests or her fields can yield
above a couch of sacred cusa grass
on which no dreams disturb the sleeper's rest
and now the sound of music reaches them
far off at first solemn and sad and slow
rising and swelling as it nearer comes
until a long procession comes in view
four brahmans first bearing in bowls the fire
no more to burn on one deserted hearth
then stately brahmans on their shoulders bore
a noble brother of their sacred caste
in manhood's bloom and early prime cut down
then brahman youth bearing a little child
half hid in flowers and as in seeming sleep
then other brahmans in a litter bore
one young and fair in early womanhood
her youthful beauty joined with matron grace
in bridal dress adorned with costly gems
the very face the prince had dreaming seen
the very child she carried in her arms
then many more uncovered four by four
the aged first then those in manhood's prime
and then the young with many acolytes
chanting in unison their sacred hymns
accompanied by many instruments
both wind and string in solemn symphony
and at respectful distance other castes
afraid to touch a brahman's sacred robes
or even mingle with his grief their tears
and when they reached the fragrant funeral pile
weeping they placed their dead on their last couch
the child within its father's nerveless arms
and when all funeral rites had been performed
the widow circled thrice the funeral pile
distributing her gifts with lavish hand
bidding her friends a long and last farewell
then stopped and raised her tearless eyes and said
farewell a long farewell to life and friends!
farewell! o earth and air and sacred sun!
nanda my lord udra my child I come!
then pale but calm with fixed ecstatic gaze
and steady steps she mounts the funeral pile
crying they beckon me! I come! I come!
then sunk as if the silver cord were loosed
as still as death upon her silent dead
instant the flames from the four corners leaped
mingling in one devouring eager blaze
no groan no cry only the crackling flames
the wailing notes of many instruments
and solemn chant by many voices raised
perfect is she who follows thus her lord
o dark and cruel creeds o perfect love
fitter for heaven than this sad world of ours!
more than enough the prince had seen and heard
bowed by the grievous burdens others bore
feeling for others' sorrows as his own
tears of divinest pity filled his eyes
and deep and all embracing love his heart
home he returned no more to find its rest
but soon a light shines in that troubled house
a son is born to sweet yasodhara
their eyes saw not neither do ours that sun
whose light is wisdom and whose heat is love
sending through nature waves of living light
giving its life to everything that lives
which through the innocence of little ones
as through wide open windows sends his rays
to light the darkest warm the coldest heart
sweet infancy! life's solace and its rest
driving away the loneliness of age
wreathing in smiles the wrinkled brow of care
nectar to joyful balm to troubled hearts
joyful once more is king suddhodana
a placid joy beams from that mother's face
joy lit the palace flew from street to street
and from the city over hill and plain
joy filled the prince's agitated soul
he felt a power from whence he could not tell
drawing away he knew not where it led
he knew the dreaded separation near
yet half its pain and bitterness was passed
he need not leave his loved ones comfortless
his loving people still would have their prince
the king in young rahula have his son
and sweet yasodhara his very life
would have that nearest dearest comforter
to soothe her cares and drive away her tears
but now strange dreams disturb the good old king
dreams starting him in terror from his sleep
yet seeming prophecies of coming good
he dreamed he saw the flag his fathers loved
in tatters torn and trailing in the dust
but in its place another glorious flag
whose silken folds seemed woven thick with gems
that as it waved glittered with dazzling light
he dreamed he saw proud embassies from far
bringing the crowns and scepters of the earth
bowing in reverence before the prince
humbly entreating him to be their king
from whom he fled in haste as if in fear
then dreamed he saw his son in tattered robes
begging from sudras for his daily bread
again he dreamed he saw the ancient tower
where he in worship had so often knelt
rising and shining clothed with living light
and on its top the prince beaming with love
scattering with lavish hand the richest gems
on eager crowds that caught them as they fell
but soon it vanished and he saw a hill
rugged and bleak cliff crowned and bald and bare
and there he saw the prince kneeling alone
wasted with cruel fastings till his bones
clave to his skin and in his sunken eyes
with fitful flicker gleamed the lamp of life
until they closed and on the ground he sank
as if in death or in a deadly swoon
and then the hill sank to a spreading plain
stretching beyond the keenest vision's ken
covered with multitudes as numberless
as ocean's sands or autumn's forest leaves
and mounted on a giant elephant
white as the snows on himalaya's peaks
the prince rode through their midst in royal state
and as he moved along he heard a shout
rising and swelling like the mighty voice
of many waters breaking on the shore
all hail! great chakravartin king of kings!
hail! king of righteousness! hail! prince of peace!
strange dreams! where is their birthplace where their home
lighter than foam upon the crested wave
fleeter than shadows of the passing cloud
they are of such fantastic substance made
that quick as thought they change their fickle forms
now grander than the waking vision views
now stranger than the wildest fancy feigns
and now so grim and terrible they start
the hardened conscience from its guilty sleep
in troops they come trooping they fly away
waved into being by the magic wand
of some deep purpose of the inmost soul
some hidden joy or sorrow guilt or fear
or better as the wise of old believed
called into being by some heavenly guest
to soothe to warn instruct or terrify
strange dreams by night and troubled thoughts by day
disturb the prince and banish quiet sleep
he dreamed that darkness visible and dense
shrouded the heavens and brooded o'er the earth
whose rayless formless vacant nothingness
curdled his blood and made his eyeballs ache
when suddenly from out this empty void
a cloud shining with golden light was borne
by gentle winds loaded with sweet perfumes
sweeter than spring time on this earth can yield
the cloud passed just above him and he saw
myriads of cherub faces looking down
sweet as rahula freed from earthly stain
such faces mortal brush could never paint
enraptured raphael ne'er such faces saw
but still the outer darkness hovered near
and ever and anon a bony hand
darts out to snatch some cherub face away
then dreamed he saw a broad and pleasant land
with cities gardens groves and fruitful fields
where bee fed flowers half hide the ripening fruits
and spicy breezes stir the trembling leaves
and many birds make sweetest melody
but bordered by a valley black as night
that ever vomits from its sunless depths
great whirling clouds of suffocating smoke
blacker than hide the burning aetna's head
blacker than over lake avernus hung
no bird could fly above its fatal fumes
eagles on tireless pinions upward borne
in widening circles rising toward the sun
venturing too near its exhalations fall
as sinks the plummet in the silent sea
and lions springing on their antlered prey
drop still and lifeless on its deadly brink
only the jackal's dismal howl is heard
to break its stillness and eternal sleep
he was borne forward to the very verge
of this dark valley by some power unseen
a wind that pierced his marrow parts the clouds
and far within below he saw a sight
that stood his hair on end beaded his brow
with icy drops and made his blood run cold
he saw a lofty throne blacker than jet
but shining with a strange and baleful light
that made him shade his blinded dazzled eyes
and seated on that throne a ghastly form
that seemed a giant human skeleton
but yet in motion terrible and quick
as lightning killing ere the thunders roll
his fleshless skull had on a seeming crown
while from his sunken sockets glared his eyes
like coals of fire or eyes of basilisk
and from his bony hand each instant flew
unerring darts that flew to pierce and kill
piercing the infant in its mother's arms
the mother when she feels her first born's breath
piercing the father in his happy home
piercing the lover tasting love's first kiss
piercing the vanquished when his banners fall
piercing the victor 'mid triumphant shouts
piercing the mighty monarch on his throne
while from a towering cypress growing near
every disease to which frail flesh is heir
like ravening vultures watch each arrow's flight
and quick as thought glide off on raven's wings
to bring the wounded writhing victim in
as well trained hunters mark their master's aim
then fly to bring the wounded quarry home
meanwhile a stifling stench rose from below
as from a battle field where nations met
and fiery ranks of living valor fought
now food for vultures moldering cold and low
and bleaching bones were scattered everywhere
startled he wakes and rises from his couch
the lamps shine down with soft and mellow light
the fair yasodhara still lay in sleep
but not in quiet sleep her bosom heaved
as if a sigh were seeking to escape
her brows were knit as if in pain or fear
and tears were stealing from her close shut lids
but sweet rahula slept and sleeping smiled
as if he too those cherub faces saw
in haste alone he noiselessly stole forth
to wander in the park and cool his brow
and calm his burdened agitated soul
the night had reached that hour preceding dawn
when nature seems in solemn silence hushed
awed by the glories of the coming day
the moon hung low above the western plains
unnumbered stars with double brightness shine
and half transparent mists the landscape veil
through which the mountains in dim grandeur rise
silent alone he crossed the maidan wide
where first he saw the sweet yasodhara
where joyful multitudes so often met
now still as that dark valley of his dream
he passed the lake mirror of heaven's high vault
whose ruffled waters ripple on the shore
stirred by cool breezes from the snow capped peaks
and heedless of his way passed on and up
through giant cedars and the lofty pines
over a leafy carpet velvet soft
while solemn voices from their branches sound
strangely in unison with his sad soul
and on and up until he reached a spot
above the trees above the mist wrapped world
where opening chasms yawned on every side
perforce he stopped and roused from revery
gazed on the dark and silent world below
the moon had sunk from sight the stars grew dim
and densest darkness veiled the sleeping world
when suddenly bright beams of rosy light
shot up the east the highest mountain top
glittered as if both land and sea had joined
their richest jewels and most costly gems
to make its crown from mountain peak to peak
the brightness spread and darkness slunk away
until between two giant mountain tops
glittered a wedge of gold the hills were tinged
and soon the sun flooded the world with light
as when the darkness heard that first command
let there be light! and light from chaos shone
raptured he gazed upon the glorious scene
and can it be he said with floods of light
filling the blue and boundless vault above
bathing in brightness mountain hill and plain
sending its rays to ocean's hidden depths
with light for bird and beast and creeping thing
light for all eyes oceans of light to spare
that man alone from outer darkness comes
gropes blindly on his brief and restless round
and then in starless darkness disappears
there must be light fountains of living light
for which my thirsty spirit pining pants
as pants the hunted hart for water brooks
another sun lighting a better world
where weary souls may find a welcome rest
gladly I'd climb yon giddy mountain heights
or gladly take the morning's wings and fly
to earth's remotest bounds if light were there
welcome to me the hermit's lonely cell
and welcome dangers labors fastings pains
all would be welcome could I bring the light
to myriads now in hopeless darkness sunk
farewell to kingdom comforts home and friends!
all will I leave to seek this glorious light
the die is cast the victory is gained
though love of people parent wife and child
half selfish half divine may bid him pause
a higher love unselfish all divine
for them and every soul bade him go forth
to seek for light and seek till light be found
home he returned now strong to say farewell
meanwhile the sweet yasodhara still slept
and dreamed she saw siddartha's empty couch
she dreamed she saw him flying far away
and when she called to him he answered not
but only stopped his ears and faster flew
until he seemed a speck and then was gone
and then she heard a mighty voice cry out
the time has come his glory shall appear!
waked by that voice she found his empty couch
siddartha gone and with him every joy
but not all joy for there rahula lay
with great wide open eyes and cherub smile
watching the lights that flickered on the wall
caught in her arms she pressed him to her heart
to still its tumult and to ease its pain
but now that step she knew so well is heard
siddartha comes filled with unselfish love
until his face beamed with celestial light
that like a holy halo crowned his head
gently he spoke my dearest and my best
the time has come the time when we must part
let not your heart be troubled it is best
this said a tender kiss spoke to her heart
in love's own language of unchanging love
when sweet rahula stretched his little arms
and cooing asked his share of tenderness
siddartha from her bosom took their boy
and though sore troubled both together smiled
and with him playing that sweet jargon spoke
which though no lexicon contains its words
seems like the speech of angels poorly learned
for every sound and syllable and word
was filled brimful of pure and perfect love
at length grown calm they tenderly communed
of all their past of all their hopes and fears
and when the time of separation came
his holy resolution gave her strength
to give the last embrace and say farewell
and forth he rode mounted on kantaka
a prince a loving father husband son
to exile driven by all embracing love
what wonder as the ancient writings say
that nature to her inmost depths was stirred
and as he passed the birds burst forth in song
fearless of hawk or kite that hovered near
what wonder that the beasts of field and wood
and all the jungle's savage denizens
gathered in groups and gamboled fearlessly
leopards with kids and wolves with skipping lambs
for he who rode alone bowed down and sad
taught millions crores of millions yet unborn
to treat with kindness every living thing
what wonder that the deepest hells were stirred
what wonder that the heavens were filled with joy
for he bowed down with sorrow going forth
shall come with joy and teach all men the way
from earth's sad turmoil to nirvana's rest

far from his kingdom far from home and friends
the prince has gone his flowing locks close shorn
his rings and soft apparel laid aside
all signs of rank and royalty cast off
clothed in a yellow robe simple and coarse
through unknown streets from door to door he passed
holding an alms bowl forth for willing gifts
but when won by his stateliness and grace
they brought their choicest stores he gently said
not so my friends keep such for those who need
the sick and old give me but common food
and when sufficient for the day was given
he took a way leading without the walls
and through rich gardens through the fruitful fields
under dark mangoes and the jujube trees
eastward toward sailagiri hill of gems
and through an ancient grove skirting its base
where soothed by every soft and tranquil sound
full many saints were wearing out their days
in meditation earnest deep intent
seeking to solve the mystery of life
seeking by leaving all its joys and cares
seeking by doubling all its woes and pains
to gain an entrance to eternal rest
and winding up its rugged sides to where
a shoulder of the mountain sloping west
o'erhangs a cave with wild figs canopied
this mountain cave was now his dwelling place
a stone his pillow and the earth his bed
his earthen alms bowl holding all his stores
except the crystal waters murmuring near
a lonely path rugged and rough and steep
a lonely cave its stillness only stirred
by eagle's scream or raven's solemn croak
or by the distant city's softened sounds
save when a sudden tempest breaks above
and rolling thunders shake the trembling hills
a path since worn by countless pilgrims' feet
coming from far to view this hallowed spot
and bow in worship on his hard cold bed
and press his pillow with their loving lips
for here for six long years the world renowned
the tender lover of all living things
fasted and watched and wrestled for the light
less for himself than for a weeping world
and here arrived he ate his simple meal
and then in silent meditation sat
the livelong day heedless of noon's fierce heat
that sent to covert birds and panting beasts
and from the parched and glowing plain sent up
as from a furnace gusts of scorching air
through which the city's walls the rocks and trees
all seemed to tremble quiver glow and shake
as if a palsy shook the trembling world
heedless of loosened rocks that crashed so near
and dashed and thundered to the depths below
and of the shepherds who with wondering awe
came near to gaze upon his noble form
and gentle loving but majestic face
and thought some god had deigned to visit men
and thus he sat still as the rock his seat
seeking to pierce the void from whence man came
to look beyond the veil that shuts him in
to find a clue to life's dark labyrinth
seeking to know why man is cast adrift
upon the bosom of a troubled sea
his boat so frail his helm and compass lost
to sink at last in dull oblivion's depths
when nature seems so perfect and complete
grand as a whole and perfect all its parts
which from the greatest to the least proclaims
that wisdom watchfulness and power and love
which built the mountains spread the earth abroad
and fixed the bounds that ocean cannot pass
which taught the seasons their accustomed rounds
lest seed time and the happy harvests fail
which guides the stars in their celestial course
and guides the pigeon's swift unerring flight
o'er mountain sea and plain and desert waste
straight as an arrow to her distant home
teaching the ant for winter to prepare
clothing the lily in its princely pride
watching the tiny sparrow when it falls
nothing too great for his almighty arm
nothing too small for his all seeing eye
nothing too mean for his paternal care
and thus he mused seeking to find a light
to guide men on their dark and weary way
and through the valley and the shades of death
until the glories of the setting sun
called him to vespers and his evening meal
then roused from revery ablutions made
eight times he bowed just as the setting sun
a fiery red sunk slowly out of sight
beyond the western plains gilded and tinged
misty and vast beneath a brilliant sky
shaded from brightest gold to softest rose
then after supper back and forth he paced
upon the narrow rock before his cave
seeking to ease his numbed and stiffened limbs
while evening's sombre shadows slowly crept
from plain to hill and highest mountain top
and solemn silence settled on the world
save for the night jar's cry and owl's complaint
while many lights from out the city gleam
and thickening stars spangle the azure vault
until the moon with soft and silvery light
half veils and half reveals the sleeping world
and then he slept for weary souls must sleep
as well as bodies worn with daily toil
and as he lay stretched on his hard cold bed
his youthful blood again bounds freely on
repairing wastes the weary day had made
and then he dreamed sometimes he dreamed of home
of young rahula reaching out his arms
of sweet yasodhara with loving words
cheering him on as love alone can cheer
sometimes he dreamed he saw that living light
for which his earnest soul so long had yearned
but over hills and mountains far away
and then he seemed with labored steps to climb
down giddy cliffs far harder than ascent
while yawning chasms threatened to devour
and beetling cliffs precluded all retreat
but still the way seemed opening step by step
until he reached the valley's lowest depths
where twilight reigned and grim and ghastly forms
with flaming swords obstruct his onward way
but his all conquering love still urged him on
when with wild shrieks they vanished in thin air
and then he climbed clinging to jutting cliffs
and stunted trees that from each crevice grew
till weary breathless he regained the heights
to see that light nearer but still so far
and thus he slept and thus sometimes he dreamed
but rose before the dawn had tinged the east
before the jungle cock had made his call
when thoughts are clearest and the world is still
refreshed and strengthened for his daily search
into the seeds of sorrow germs of pain
after a light to scatter doubts and fears
but when the coming day silvered the east
and warmed that silver into softest gold
and faintest rose tints tinged the passing clouds
he as the vedas taught each morning bathed
in the clear stream that murmured near his cave
then bowed in reverence to the rising sun
as from behind the glittering mountain peaks
it burst in glory on the waking world
then bowl and staff in hand he took his way
along his mountain path and through the grove
and through the gardens through the fruitful fields
down to the city for his daily alms
while children his expected coming watch
and running cry the gracious rishi comes
all gladly gave and soon his bowl was filled
for he repaid their gifts with gracious thanks
and his unbounded love clearer than words
spoke to their hearts as he passed gently on
even stolid plowmen after him would look
wondering that one so stately and so grand
should even for them have kind and gracious words
sometimes while passing through the sacred grove
he paused beneath an aged banyan tree
whose spreading branches drooping down took root
to grow again in other giant trunks
an ever widening ever deepening shade
where five like him in manhood's early prime
each bound to life by all its tender ties
high born and rich had left their happy homes
their only food chance gathered day by day
their only roof this spreading banyan tree
and there long time they earnestly communed
seeking to aid each other in the search
for higher life and for a clearer light
and here under a sacred peepul's shade
two brahmans famed for sanctity had dwelt
for many years all cares of life cast off
who by long fastings sought to make the veil
of flesh translucent to the inner eye
eyes fixed intently on the nose's tip
to lose all consciousness of outward things
by breath suppressed to still the outer pulse
so that the soul might wake to conscious life
and on unfolded wings unchecked might rise
and in the purest auras freely soar
above cross currents that engender clouds
where thunders roll and quick cross lightnings play
to view the world of causes and of life
and bathe in light that knows no night no change
with eager questionings he sought to learn
while they with gentle answers gladly taught
all that their self denying search had learned
and thus he passed his days and months and years
in constant patient earnest search for light
with longer fastings and more earnest search
while day by day his body frailer grew
until his soul loosed from its earthly bonds
sometimes escaped its narrow prison house
and like the lark to heaven's gate it soared
to view the glories of the coming dawn
but as he rose the sad and sorrowing world
for which his soul with tender love had yearned
seemed deeper in the nether darkness sunk
beyond his reach beyond his power to save
when sadly to his prison house he turned
wishing no light that did not shine for all
six years had passed six long and weary years
since first he left the world to seek for light
knowledge he found knowledge that soared aloft
to giddy heights and sounded hidden depths
secrets of knowledge that the brahmans taught
the favored few but far beyond the reach
of those who toil and weep and cry for help
a light that gilds the highest mountain tops
but leaves the fields and valleys dark and cold
but not that living light for which he yearned
to light life's humble walks and common ways
and send its warmth to every heart and home
as spring time sends a warm and genial glow
to every hill and valley grove and field
clothing in softest verdure common grass
as well as sandal trees and lofty palms
one night when hope seemed yielding to despair
sleepless he lay upon the earth his bed
when suddenly a white and dazzling light
shone through the cave and all was dark again
startled he rose then prostrate in the dust
his inmost soul breathed forth an earnest prayer
that he who made the light would make it shine
clearer and clearer to that perfect day
when innocence and peace and righteousness
might fill the earth and ignorance and fear
and cruelty and crime might fly away
as birds of night and savage prowling beasts
fly from the glories of the rising sun
long time he lay wrestling in earnest prayer
when from the eastern wall one clothed in light
beaming with love and halo crowned appeared
and gently said siddartha rise! go forth!
waste not your days in fasts your nights in tears!
give what you have do what you find to do
with gentle admonitions check the strong
with loving counsels aid and guide the weak
and light will come the day will surely dawn
this said the light grew dim the form was gone
but hope revived his heart was strong again
joyful he rose and when the rising sun
had filled the earth's dark places full of light
with all his worldly wealth his staff and bowl
obedient to that voice he left his cave
when from a shepherd's cottage near his way
whence he had often heard the busy hum
of industry and childhood's merry laugh
there came the angry stern command of one
clothed in a little brief authority
mingled with earnest pleadings and the wail
of women's voices and above them all
the plaintive treble of a little child
thither he turned and when he reached the spot
the cause of all this sorrow was revealed
one from the king had seized their little all
their goats and sheep and e'en the child's pet lamb
but when they saw him they had often watched
with reverent awe as if come down from heaven
prostrate they fell and kissed his garment's hem
while he so insolent now stood abashed
and self accused he thus excused himself
the brahmans make this day a sacrifice
and they demand unblemished goats and lambs
I but obey the king's express command
to bring them to the temple ere high noon
but buddha stooped and raised the little child
who nestled in his arms in perfect trust
and gently said rise up my friends weep not!
the king must be obeyed but kings have hearts
I go along to be your advocate
the king may spare what zealous priest would kill
thinking the gods above delight in blood
but when the officers would drive the flock
with staves and slings and loud and angry cries
they only scattered them among the rocks
and buddha bade the shepherd call his own
as love can lead where force in vain would drive
he called they knew his voice and followed him
dumb innocents down to the slaughter led
while buddha kissed the child and followed them
with those so late made insolent by power
now dumb as if led out to punishment
meanwhile the temple gates wide open stood
and when the king in royal purple robed
and decked with gems attended by his court
to clash of cymbals sound of shell and drum
through streets swept clean and sprinkled with perfumes
adorned with flags and filled with shouting crowds
drew near the sacred shrine a greater came
through unswept ways where dwelt the toiling poor
huddled in wretched huts breathing foul air
living in fetid filth and poverty
no childhood's joys youth prematurely old
manhood a painful struggle but to live
and age a weary shifting of the scene
while all the people drew aside to gaze
upon his gentle but majestic face
beaming with tender all embracing love
and when the king and royal train dismount
'mid prostrate people and the stately priests
on fragrant flowers that carpeted his way
and mount the lofty steps to reach the shrine
siddartha came upon the other side
'mid stalls for victims sheds for sacred wood
and rude attendants on the pompous rites
who seized a goat the patriarch of the flock
and bound him firm with sacred munja grass
and bore aloft while buddha followed where
a priest before the blazing altar stood
with glittering knife and others fed the fires
while clouds of incense from the altar rose
sweeter than araby the blest can yield
and white robed brahmans chant their sacred hymns
and there before that ancient shrine they met
the king the priests the hermit from the hill
when one an aged brahman raised his hands
and praying lifted up his voice and cried
o hear! great indra from thy lofty throne
on meru's holy mountain high in heaven
let every good the king has ever done
with this sweet incense mingled rise to thee
and every secret every open sin
be laid upon this goat to sink from sight
drunk by the earth with his hot spouting blood
or on this altar with his flesh be burned
and all the brahman choir responsive cried
long live the king! now let the victim die!
but buddha said let him not strike o king!
for how can god being good delight in blood
and how can blood wash out the stains of sin
and change the fixed eternal law of life
that good from good evil from evil flows
this said he stooped and loosed the panting goat
none staying him so great his presence was
and then with loving tenderness he taught
how sin works out its own sure punishment
how like corroding rust and eating moth
it wastes the very substance of the soul
like poisoned blood it surely drop by drop
pollutes the very fountain of the life
like deadly drug it changes into stone
the living fibres of a loving heart
like fell disease it breeds within the veins
the living agents of a living death
and as in gardens overgrown with weeds
nothing but patient labor day by day
uprooting cherished evils one by one
watering its soil with penitential tears
can fit the soul to grow that precious seed
which taking root spreads out a grateful shade
where gentle thoughts like singing birds may lodge
where pure desires like fragrant flowers may bloom
and loving acts like ripened fruits may hang
then chiding not with earnest words he urged
humanity to man kindness to beasts
pure words kind acts in all our daily walks
as better than the blood of lambs and goats
better than incense or the chanted hymn
to cleanse the heart and please the powers above
and fill the world with harmony and peace
till pricked in heart the priest let fall his knife
the brahmans listening ceased to chant their hymns
the king drank in his words with eager ears
and from that day no altar dripped with blood
but flowers instead breathed forth their sweet perfumes
and when that troubled day drew near its close
joy filled once more that shepherd's humble home
from door to door his simple story flew
and when the king entered his palace gates
new thoughts were surging in his wakened soul
but though the beasts have lairs the birds have nests
buddha had not whereon to lay his head
not even a mountain cave to call his home
and forth he fared heedless about his way
for every way was now alike to him
heedless of food his alms bowl hung unused
while all the people stood aside with awe
and to their children pointed out the man
who plead the shepherd's cause before the king
at length he passed the city's western gate
and crossed the little plain circling its walls
circled itself by five bold hills that rise
a rugged rampart and an outer wall
two outer gates this mountain rampart had
the one a narrow valley opening west
toward gaya through the red barabar hills
through which the rapid phalgu swiftly glides
down from the vindhya mountains far away
then gently winds around this fruitful plain
its surface green with floating lotus leaves
and bright with lotus blossoms blue and white
o'erhung with drooping trees and trailing vines
till through the eastern gate it hastens on
to lose itself in gunga's sacred stream
toward gaya now siddartha bent his steps
distant the journey of a single day
as men marked distance in those ancient times
no longer heeded in this headlong age
when we count moments by the miles we pass
and one may see the sun sink out of sight
behind great banks of gray and wintry clouds
while feathery snowflakes fill the frosty air
and after quiet sleep may wake next day
to see it bathe green fields with floods of light
and dry the sparkling dew from opening flowers
and hear the joyful burst of vernal song
and breathe the balmy air of opening spring
and as he went weary and faint and sad
the valley opening showed a pleasant grove
where many trees mingled their grateful shade
and many blossoms blended sweet perfumes
and there under a drooping vakul tree
a bower of roses and sweet jasmine vines
within a couch without a banquet spread
while near a fountain with its falling spray
ruffled the surface of a shining pool
whose liquid cadence mingled with the songs
of many birds concealed among the trees
and there three seeming sister graces were
fair as young venus rising from the sea
the one in seeming childlike innocence
bathed in the pool while her low liquid laugh
rung sweet and clear and one her vina tuned
and as she played the other lightly danced
clapping her hands tinkling her silver bells
whose gauzy silken garments seemed to show
rather than hide her slender graceful limbs
and she who played the vina sweetly sang
come to our bower and take your rest
life is a weary road at best
eat for your board is richly spread
drink for your wine is sparkling red
rest for the weary day is past
sleep for the shadows gather fast
tune not your vina strings too high
strained they will break and the music die
come to our bower and take your rest
life is a weary road at best
but buddha full of pity passing said
alas poor soul! flitting a little while
like painted butterflies before the lamp
that soon will burn your wings like silly doves
calling the cruel kite to seize and kill
displaying lights to be the robber's guide
enticing men to wrong who soon despise
ah! poor perverted cold and cruel world!
delights of love become the lures of lust
the joys of heaven changed into fires of hell

now mighty mara spirit of the air
the prince of darkness ruling worlds below
had watched for buddha all these weary years
seeking to lead his steady steps astray
by many wiles his wicked wit devised
lest he at length should find the living light
and rescue millions from his dark domains
now showing him the kingdoms of the world
he offered him the chakravartin's crown
now opening seas of knowledge shoreless vast
knowledge of ages past and yet to come
knowledge of nature and the hidden laws
that guide her changes guide the roiling spheres
sakwal on sakwal boundless infinite
yet ever moving on in harmony
he thought to puff his spirit up with pride
till he should quite forget a suffering world
in sin and sorrow groping blindly on
but when he saw that lust of power moved not
and thirst for knowledge turned him not aside
from earnest search after the living light
from tender love for every living thing
he sent the tempters doubt and dark despair
and as he watched for final victory
he saw that light flash through the silent cave
and heard the buddha breathe that earnest prayer
and fled amazed nor dared to look behind
for though to buddha all his way seemed dark
his wily enemy could see a power
a mighty power that ever hovered near
a present help in every time of need
when sinking souls seek earnestly for aid
he fled indeed as flies the prowling wolf
alarmed at watch dog's bark or shepherd's voice
while seeking entrance to the slumbering fold
but soon returns with soft and stealthy step
with keenest scent snuffing the passing breeze
with ears erect catching each slightest sound
with glaring eyes watching each moving thing
with hungry jaws skulking about the fold
till coming dawn drives him to seek his lair
so mara fled and so he soon returned
and thus he watched the buddha's every step
saw him with gentleness quell haughty power
saw him with tenderness raise up the weak
heard him before the brahmans and the king
denounce those bloody rites ordained by him
heard him declare the deadly work of sin
his own prime minister and eldest born
heard him proclaim the mighty power of love
to cleanse the life and make the flinty heart
as soft as sinews of the new born babe
and when he saw whither he bent his steps
he sent three wrinkled hags deformed and foul
the willing agents of his wicked will
life wasting idleness the thief of time
lascivious lust whose very touch defiles
poisoning the blood polluting all within
and greedy gluttony most gross of all
whose ravening maw forever asks for more
to that delightful garden near his way
to tempt the master their true forms concealed
for who so gross that such coarse hags could tempt
but clothed instead in youthful beauty's grace
and now he saw him pass unmoved by lust
nor yet with cold self righteous pride puffed up
but breathing pity from his inmost soul
e'en for the ministers of vice themselves
defeated not discouraged still he thought
to try one last device for well he knew
that buddha's steps approached the sacred tree
where light would dawn and all his power would end
upon a seat beside the shaded path
a seeming aged brahman mara sat
and when the prince approached his tempter rose
saluting him with gentle stateliness
saluted in return with equal grace
whither away my son the tempter said
if you to gaya now direct your steps
perhaps your youth may cheer my lonely age
I go to seek for light the prince replied
but where it matters not so light be found
but mara answered him your search is vain
why seek to know more than the vedas teach
why seek to learn more than the teachers know
but such is youth the rosy tints of dawn
tinge all his thoughts 'excelsior!' he cries
and fain would scale the unsubstantial clouds
to find a light that knows no night no change
we brahmans chant our hymns in solemn wise
the vulgar listen with profoundest awe
but still our muffled heart throbs beat the march
onward forever onward to the grave
when one ahead cries 'lo! I see a light!'
and others clutch his garments following on
till all in starless darkness disappear
there may be day beyond this starless night
there may be life beyond this dark profound
but who has ever seen that changeless day
what steps have e'er retraced that silent road
fables there are hallowed by hoary age
fables and ancient creeds that men have made
to give them power with ignorance and fear
fables of gods with human passions filled
fables of men who walked and talked with gods
fables of kalpas passed when brahma slept
and all created things were wrapped in flames
and then the floods descended chaos reigned
the world a waste of waters and the heavens
a sunless void until again he wakes
and sun and moon and stars resume their rounds
oceans receding show the mountain tops
and then the hills and spreading plains
strange fables all that crafty men have feigned
why waste your time pursuing such vain dreams
as some benighted travelers chase false lights
to lose themselves in bogs and fens at last
but read instead in nature's open book
how light from darkness grew by slow degrees
how crawling worms grew into light winged birds
acquiring sweetest notes and gayest plumes
how lowly ferns grew into lofty palms
how men have made themselves from chattering apes
how even from protoplasm to highest bard
selecting and rejecting mind has grown
until at length all secrets are unlocked
and man himself now stands pre eminent
maker and master of his own great self
to sneer at all his lisping childlike past
and laugh at all his fathers had revered
the prince with gentle earnestness replied
full well I know how blindly we grope on
in doubt and fear and ignorance profound
the wisdom of the past a book now sealed
but why despise what ages have revered
as some rude plowman casts on rubbish heaps
the rusty casket that his share reveals
not knowing that within it are concealed
most precious gems to make him rich indeed
the hand that hid them from the robber cold
the key that locked this rusty casket lost
the past was wise else whence that wondrous tongue
that we call sacred which the learned speak
now passing out of use as too refined
for this rude age too smooth for our rough tongues
too rich and delicate for our coarse thoughts
why should such men make fables so absurd
unless within their rough outside is stored
some precious truth from profanation hid
revere your own revile no other faith
lest with the casket you reject the gems
or with rough hulls reject the living seed
doubtless in nature changes have been wrought
that speak of ages in the distant past
whose contemplation fills the mind with awe
the smooth worn pebbles on the highest hills
speak of an ocean sweeping o'er their tops
the giant palms now changed to solid rocks
speak of the wonders of a buried world
why seek to solve the riddle nature puts
of whence and why with theories and dreams
the crawling worm proclaims its maker's power
the singing bird proclaims its maker's skill
the mind of man proclaims a greater mind
whose will makes world whose thoughts are living acts
our every heart throb speaks of present power
preserving recreating day by day
better confess how little we can know
better with feet unshod and humble awe
approach this living power to ask for aid
and as he spoke the devas filled the air
unseen unheard of men and sweetly sung
hail prince of peace! hail harbinger of day!
the darkness vanishes the light appears
but mara heard and silent slunk away
the o'erwrought prince fell prostrate on the ground
and lay entranced while devas hovered near
watching each heart throb breathing that sweet calm
its guardian angel gives the sleeping child
the night has passed the day star fades from sight
and morning's softest tint of rose and gold
tinges the east and tips the mountain tops
the silent village stirs with waking life
the bleat of goats and low of distant herds
the song of birds and crow of jungle cocks
breathe softest music through the dewy air
and now two girls just grown to womanhood
the lovely daughters of the village lord
trapusha one and one balika called
up with the dawn trip lightly o'er the grass
bringing rich curds and rice picked grain by grain
a willing offering to their guardian god
who dwelt as all the simple folk believed
beneath an aged bodhi tree that stood
beside the path and near where buddha lay
to ask such husbands as their fancies paint
gentle and strong and noble true and brave
and having left their gifts and made their vows
with timid steps the maidens stole away
but while the outer world is filled with life
that inner world from whence this life proceeds
concealed from sight by matter's blinding folds
whose coarser currents fill with wondrous power
the nervous fluid of the universe
which darts through nature's frame from star to star
from cloud to cloud filling the world with awe
now harnessed to our use a patient drudge
heedless of time or space bears human thought
from land to land and through the ocean's depths
and bears the softest tones of human speech
faster than light farther than ocean sounds
and whirls the clattering car through crowded streets
and floods with light the haunts of prowling thieves
that inner world whose very life is love
pure love and perfect infinite intense
that world is now astir a rift appears
in those dark clouds that rise from sinful souls
and hide from us its clear celestial light
and clouds of messengers from that bright world
whom they called devas and we angels call
rush to that rift to rescue and to save
the wind from their bright wings fanned buddha's soul
the love from their sweet spirits warmed his heart
he starts from sleep but rising scarcely knows
if he had seen a vision while awake
or sunk in sleep had dreamed a heavenly dream
from that pure presence all his tempters fled
the calm of conflict ended filled his soul
and led by unseen hands he forward passed
to where the sacred fig tree long had grown
beneath whose shade the village altar stood
where simple folk would place their willing gifts
and ask the aid their simple wants required
believing all the life above around
the life within themselves must surely come
from living powers that ever hovered near
here lay the food sagata's daughters brought
the choicest products of his herds and fields
this grateful food met nature's every need
diffused a healthful glow through all his frame
and all the body's eager yearnings stilled
seven days he sat and ate no more nor drank
yet hungered not nor burned with parching thirst
for heavenly manna fed his hungry soul
its wants were satisfied the body's ceased
seven days he sat in sweet internal peace
waiting for light and sure that light would come
when seeming scales fell from his inner sight
his spirit's eyes were opened and he saw
not far away but near within above
as dwells the soul within this mortal frame
a world within this workday world of ours
the living soul of all material things
eastward he saw a never setting sun
whose light is truth the light of all the worlds
whose heat is tender all embracing love
the inmost life of everything that lives
the mighty prototype and primal cause
of all the suns that light this universe
from ours full orbed that tints the glowing east
and paints the west a thousand varied shades
to that far distant little twinkling star
that seems no larger than the glow worm's lamp
itself a sun to light such worlds as ours
and round about him clouds of living light
bright clouds of cherubim and seraphim
who sing his praise and execute his will
not idly singing as the foolish feign
but voicing forth their joy they work and sing
doing his will their works sound forth his praise
on every side were fields of living green
with gardens groves and gently rising hills
where crystal streams of living waters flow
and dim with distance meru's lofty heights
no desert sands no mountains crowned with ice
for here the scorching simoom never blows
nor wintry winds that pierce and freeze and kill
but gentle breezes breathing sweet perfumes
no weeds no thorns no bitter poisonous fruits
no noxious reptiles and no prowling beasts
for in this world of innocence and love
no evil thoughts give birth to evil things
but many birds of every varied plume
delight the ear with sweetest melody
and many flowers of every varied tint
fill all the air with odors rich and sweet
and many fruits suited to every taste
hang ripe and ready that who will may eat
a world of life with all its lights and shades
the bright original of our sad world
without its sin and storms its thorns and tears
no lethe's sluggish waters lave its shores
nor solemn shades of poet's fancy bred
sit idly here to boast of battles past
nor wailing ghosts wring here their shadowy hands
for lack of honor to their cast off dust
but living men in human bodies clothed
not bodies made of matter dull and coarse
dust from the dust and soon to dust returned
but living bodies clothing living souls
bodies responsive to the spirit's will
clothing in acts the spirit's inmost thoughts
dwell here in many mansions large and fair
stretching beyond the keenest vision's hen
with room for each and more than room for all
forever filling and yet never full
not clogged by matter fast as fleetest birds
wishing to go they go to come they come
no helpless infancy or palsied age
but all in early manhood's youthful bloom
the old grown young the child to man's estate
gentle they seemed as they passed to and fro
gentle and strong with every manly grace
busy as bees in summer's sunny hours
in works of usefulness and acts of love
no pinching poverty or grasping greed
gladly receiving they more gladly give
sharing in peace the bounties free to all
as lost in wonder and delight he gazed
he saw approaching from a pleasant grove
two noble youths yet full of gentleness
attending one from sole to crown a queen
with every charm of fresh and blooming youth
and every grace of early womanhood
her face the mirror of her gentle soul
her flowing robes finer than softest silk
that as she moved seemed woven of the light
not borne by clumsy wings or labored steps
she glided on as if her will had wings
that bore her willing body where she wished
as she approached close by her side he saw
as through a veil or thin transparent mist
the form and features of the aged king
older and frailer by six troubled years
than when they parted yet his very face
whom she was watching with the tenderest care
and nearer seen each seeming youth was two
as when at first in eden's happy shade
our primal parents ere the tempter came
were twain and yet but one so on they come
hand joined in hand heart beating close to heart
one will their guide and sharing every thought
beaming with tender all embracing love
whom god had joined and death had failed to part
what need of words to introduce his guests
love knows her own the mother greets her son
her parents and the king's who long had watched
their common offspring with a constant care
inspiring hope and breathing inward peace
when secret foes assailed on every side
now saw him burst the clouds that veiled their view
and stand triumphant full before their eyes
o happy meeting! joy profound complete!
soul greeting soul heart speaking straight to heart
while countless happy faces hovered near
and song's of joy sound through nirvana's heights
at length the transports of first meeting past
more of this new found world he wished to see
more of its peace and joy he wished to know
led by his loving guides enwrapt he saw
such scenes of beauty passing human speech
such scenes of peace and joy past human thought
that he who sings must tune a heavenly lyre
and seraphs touch his lips with living fire
my unanointed lips will not presume
to try such lofty themes glad if I gain
a distant prospect of the promised land
and catch some glimpses through the gates ajar
long time he wandered through these blissful scenes
time measured by succession of delights
till wearied by excess of very joy
both soul and body sunk in tranquil sleep
he slept while hosts of devas sweetly sung
hail great physician! savior lover friend!
joy of the worlds guide to nirvana hail!
from whose bright presence mara's myriads fled
but mara's self subtlest of all fled not
but putting on a seeming yogi's form
wasted as if by fasts to skin and bone
on one foot standing rooted to the ground
the other raised against his fleshless thigh
hands stretched aloft till joints had lost their use
and clinched so close as if in firm resolve
the nails had grown quite through the festering palms
his tattered robes as if worn out by age
hanging like moss from trees decayed and dead
while birds were nesting in his tangled hair
and thus disguised the subtle mara stood
and when the master roused him from his sleep
his tempter cried in seeming ecstasy
o! happy wakening! joy succeeding grief!
peace after trouble! rest that knows no end!
life after death! nirvana found at last!
here let us wait till wasted by decay
the body's worn out fetters drop away
much suffering brother buddha answered him
the weary traveler wandering through the night
in doubt and darkness gladly sees the dawn
the storm tossed sailor on the troubled sea
wearied and drenched with joy re enters port
but other nights succeed that happy dawn
and other seas may toss that sailor's bark
but he who sees nirvana's sacred sun
and in nirvana's haven furls his sails
no more shall wander through the starless night
no more shall battle with the winds and waves
o joy of joys! our eyes have seen that sun!
our sails have almost reached that sheltering port
but shall we joyful at our own escape
leave our poor brothers battling with the storm
sails rent barks leaking helm and compass lost
no light to guide no hope to cheer them on
each for himself must seek as we have sought
the tempter said and each must climb alone
the rugged path our weary feet have trod
no royal road leads to nirvana's rest
no royal captain guides his army there
why leave the heights with so much labor gained
why plunge in darkness we have just escaped
men will not heed the message we may bring
the great will scorn the rabble will deride
and cry 'he hath a devil and is mad'
true answered buddha each must seek to find
each for himself must leave the downward road
each for himself must choose the narrow path
that leads to purity and peace and life
but helping hands will aid those struggling up
a warning voice may check those hasting down
men are like lilies in yon shining pool
some sunk in evil grovel in the dust
loving like swine to wallow in the mire
like those that grow within its silent depths
scarce raised above its black and oozy bed
while some love good and seek the purest light
breathing sweet fragrance from their gentle lives
like those that rise above its glassy face
sparkling with dewdrops royally arrayed
drinking the brightness of the morning sun
distilling odors through the balmy air
but countless multitudes grope blindly on
shut out from light and crushed by cruel castes
willing to learn whom none will deign to teach
willing to rise whom none will deign to guide
who from the cradle to the silent grave
helpless and hopeless only toil and weep
like those that on the stagnant waters float
smothered with leaves covered with ropy slime
that from the rosy dawn to dewy eve
scarce catch one glimmer of the glorious sun
the good scarce need the bad will scorn my aid
but these poor souls will gladly welcome help
welcome to me the scorn of rich and great
welcome the brahman's proud and cold disdain
welcome revilings from the rabble rout
if I can lead some groping souls to light
if I can give some weary spirits rest
farewell my brother you have earned release
rest here in peace I go to aid the poor
and as he spoke a flash of lurid light
shot through the air and buddha stood alone
alone! to teach the warring nations peace!
alone! to lead a groping world to light!
alone! to give the heavy laden rest!
seven days had passed since first he saw the light
seven days of deep ecstatic peace and joy
of open vision of that blissful world
of sweet communion with those dwelling there
but having tasted seen and felt the joys
of that bright world where love is all in all
filling each heart inspiring every thought
guiding each will and prompting every act
he yearned to see the other darker side
of that bright picture where the wars and hates
the lust the greed the cruelty and crime
that fill the world with pain and want and woe
have found their dwelling place and final goal
quicker than eagles soaring toward the sun
till but a speck against the azure vault
swoop down upon their unsuspecting prey
quicker than watch fires on the mountain top
send warnings to the dwellers in the plain
led by his guides he reached nirvana's verge
whence he beheld a broad and pleasant plain
spread with a carpet of the richest green
and decked with flowers of every varied tint
whose blended odors fill the balmy air
where trees pleasant to sight and good for food
in rich abundance and spontaneous grow
a living stream as purest crystal clear
with gentle murmurs wound along the plain
its surface bright with fairer lotus flowers
than mortal eye on earth had ever seen
while on its banks were cool umbrageous groves
whose drooping branches spicy breezes stir
a singing bird in every waving bough
whose joyful notes the soul of music shed
a mighty multitude beyond the power
of men to number moved about the plain
some seeming strangers wander through the groves
and pluck the flowers or eat the luscious fruits
some seeming visitors from better worlds
here wait and watch as for expected guests
while angel devas clothed in innocence
whose faces beam with wisdom glow with love
with loving welcomes greet each coming guest
with loving counsels aid instruct and guide
and as he looked the countless restless throng
seemed ever changing ever moving on
so that this plain comparing great to small
seemed like a station near some royal town
greater than london or old babylon
where all the roads from some vast empire meet
and many caravans or sweeping trains
bring and remove the ever changing throng
this plain a valley bordered deep and still
the very valley of his fearful dream
seen from the other side whose rising mists
were all aglow with ever changing light
like passing clouds above the setting sun
through which as through a glass he darkly saw
unnumbered funeral trains in sable clad
to solemn music and with measured tread
bearing their dead to countless funeral piles
as thick as heaps that through the livelong day
with patient toil the sturdy woodmen rear
while clearing forests for the golden grain
and set aflame when evening's shades descend
filling the glowing woods with floods of light
and ghostly shadows so these funeral piles
send up their curling smoke and crackling flames
there eager flames devour an infant's flesh
here loving arms that risen infant clasp
there loud laments bewail a loved one lost
here joyful welcomes greet that loved one found
and there he saw a pompous funeral train
bearing a body clothed in robes of state
to blare of trumpet sound of shell and drum
while many mourners bow in silent grief
and widows orphans raise a loud lament
as for a father a protector lost
and as the flames lick up the fragrant oils
and whirl and hiss around that wasting form
an eager watcher from a better world
welcomes her husband to her open arms
the cumbrous load of pomp and power cast off
while waiting devas and the happy throng
his power protected and his bounty blessed
with joy conduct his unaccustomed steps
onward and upward to those blissful seats
where all his stores of duties well performed
of power well used and wealth in kindness given
were garnered up beyond the reach of thieves
where moths ne'er eat and rust can ne'er corrupt
another train draws near a funeral pile
of aloes sandal wood and cassia built
and drenched with every incense breathing oil
and draped with silks and rich with rarest flowers
where grim officials clothed in robes of state
placed one in royal purple decked with gems
whose word had been a trembling nation's law
whose angry nod was death to high or low
no mourners gather round this costly pile
the people shrink in terror from the sight
but sullen soldiers there keep watch and ward
while eager flames consume those nerveless hands
so often raised to threaten or command
suck out those eyes that filled the court with fear
and only left of all this royal pomp
a little dust the winds may blow away
but here that selfsame monarch comes in view
for royal purple clothed in filthy rags
and lusterless that crown of priceless gems
those eyes whose bend so lately awed the world
blinking and bleared and blinded by the light
those hands that late a royal scepter bore
shaking with fear and dripping all with blood
and as he looked that some should give him place
and lead him to a seat for monarchs fit
he only saw a group of innocents
his hands had slain now clothed in spotless white
from whom he fled as if by furies chased
fled from those groves and gardens of delight
fled on and down a broad and beaten road
by many trod and toward a desert waste
with distance dim and gloomy grim and vast
where piercing thorns and leafless briars grow
and dead sea apples ashes to the taste
where loathsome reptiles crawl and hiss and sting
and birds of night and bat winged dragons fly
where beetling cliffs seem threatening instant fall
and opening chasms seem yawning to devour
and sulphurous seas were swept with lurid flames
that seethe and boil from hidden fires below
again he saw beyond that silent vale
one frail and old without a rich man's gate
laid down to die beneath a peepul tree
and parched with thirst and pierced with sudden pain
a root his pillow and the earth his bed
alone he met the king of terrors there
whose wasting body cumbering now the ground
chandalas cast upon the passing stream
to float and fester in the fiery sun
till whirled by eddies caught by roots it lay
a prey for vultures and for fishes food
that selfsame day a dart of deadly pain
shot through that rich man's hard unfeeling heart
that laid him low beyond the power to save
e'en while his servants cast without his gates
that poor old man who came to beg him spare
his roof tree where his fathers all had died
his hearth the shrine of all his inmost joys
his little home to every heart so dear
and in due season tongues of hissing flames
that rich man's robes like snowflakes whirled in air
and curled his crackling skin consumed his flesh
and sucked the marrow from his whitened bones
but here these two their places seem to change
that rich man's houses lands and flocks and herds
his servants rich apparel stores of gold
and all he loved and lived for left behind
the friends that nature gave him turned to foes
dependents whom his greed had wronged and crushed
shrinking away as from a deadly foe
no generous wish no gentle tender thought
to hide his nakedness his shriveled soul
stood stark and bare the gaze of passers by
nothing within to draw him on and up
he slinks away and wanders on and down
till in the desert groveling in the dust
he digs and burrows seeking treasures there
while that poor man as we count poverty
is rich in all that makes the spirit's wealth
his heart so pure that thoughts of guile
and evil purpose find no lodgment there
his life so innocent that bitter words
and evil speaking ne'er escape his lips
the little that he had he freely shared
and wished it more that more he might have given
now rich in soul for here a crust of bread
in kindness shared a cup of water given
is worth far more than all potosi's mines
and araby's perfumes and india's silks
and all the cattle on a thousand hills
and clothed as with a robe of innocence
the devas welcome him his troubles passed
the conflict ended and the triumph gained
and there two brahmans press their funeral pile
and sink to dust amid the whirling flames
each from his lisping infancy had heard
that brahmans were a high and holy caste
too high and holy for the common touch
and each had learned the vedas' sacred lore
but here they parted one was cold and proud
drawing away from all the humbler castes
as made to toil and only fit to serve
the other found within those sacred books
that all were brothers made of common clay
and filled with life from one eternal source
while brahmans only elder brothers were
with greater light to be his brother's guide
with greater strength to give his brother aid
that he alone a real brahman was
who had a brahman's spirit not his blood
with patient toil from youth to hoary age
he taught the ignorant and helped the weak
and now they come where all external pomp
and rank and caste and creed are nothing worth
but when that proud and haughty brahman saw
poor sudras and chandalas clothed in white
he swept away with proud and haughty scorn
swept on and down where heartless selfishness
alone can find congenial company
the other full of joy his brothers met
and in sweet harmony they journeyed on
where higher joys await the pure in heart
and there he saw all ranks and grades and castes
chandala sudra warrior brahman prince
the wise and ignorant the strong and weak
in all the stages of our mortal round
from lisping infancy to palsied age
by all the ways to human frailty known
enter that vale of shadows deep and still
leaving behind their pomp and power and wealth
leaving their rags and wretchedness and want
and cast off bodies dust to dust returned
by flames consumed or moldering to decay
while here the real character appeared
all shows hypocrisies and shams cast off
so that a life of gentleness and love
shines through the face and molds the outer form
to living beauty blooming not to fade
while every act of cruelty and crime
seems like a gangrened ever widening wound
wasting the very substance of the soul
marring its beauty eating out its strength
and here arrived the good in little groups
together drawn by inward sympathy
and led by devas take the upward way
to those sweet fields his opened eyes had seen
those ever widening mansions of delight
while those poor souls o sad and fearful sight!
the very well springs of the life corrupt
shrink from the light and shun the pure and good
fly from the devas who with perfect love
would gladly soothe their anguish ease their pain
fly on and down that broad and beaten road
till in the distance in the darkness lost
lost! lost! and must it be forever lost
the gentle buddha's all embracing love
shrunk from the thought but rather sought relief
in that most ancient faith by sages taught
that these poor souls at length may find escape
the grasping in the gross and greedy swine
the cunning in the sly and prowling fox
the cruel in some ravening beast of prey
while those less hardened less depraved may gain
rebirth in men degraded groveling base
but here in sadness let us drop the veil
hoping that he whose ways are not like ours
whose love embraces all his handiwork
who in beginnings sees the final end
may find some way to save these sinful souls
consistent with his fixed eternal law
that good from good evil from evil flows
here buddha saw the mystery of life
at last unfolded to its hidden depths
he saw that selfishness was sorrow's root
and ignorance its dense and deadly shade
he saw that selfishness bred lust and hate
deformed the features and defiled the soul
and closed its windows to those waves of love
that flow perennial from nirvana's sun
he saw that groveling lusts and base desires
like noxious weeds unchecked luxurious grow
making a tangled jungle of the soul
where no good seed can find a place to root
where noble purposes and pure desires
and gentle thoughts wither and fade and die
like flowers beneath the deadly upas tree
he saw that selfishness bred grasping greed
and made the miser made the prowling thief
and bred hypocrisy pretense deceit
and made the bigot made the faithless priest
bred anger cruelty and thirst for blood
and made the tyrant stained the murderer's knife
and filled the world with war and want and woe
and filled the dismal regions of the lost
with fiery flames of passions never quenched
with sounds of discord sounds of clanking chains
with cries of anguish howls of bitter hate
yet saw that man was free not bound and chained
helpless and hopeless to a whirling wheel
rolled on resistless by some cruel power
regardless of their cries and prayers and tears
free to resist those gross and groveling lusts
free to obey nirvana's law of love
the law of order primal highest law
which guides the great artificer himself
who weaves the garments of the joyful spring
who paints the glories of the passing clouds
who tunes the music of the rolling spheres
guided by love in all his mighty works
filling with love the humblest willing heart
he saw that love softens and sweetens life
and stills the passions soothes the troubled breast
fills homes with joy and gives the nations peace
a sovereign balm for all the spirit's wounds
the living fountain of nirvana's bliss
for here before his eyes were countless souls
born to the sorrows of a sinful world
with burdens bowed by cares and griefs oppressed
who felt for others' sorrows as their own
who lent a helping hand to those in need
returning good for evil love for hate
whose garments now were white as spotless wool
whose faces beamed with gentleness and love
as onward upward devas guide their steps
nirvana's happy mansions full in view
he saw the noble eightfold path that mounts
from life's low levels to nirvana's heights
not by steep grades the strong alone can climb
but by such steps as feeblest limbs may take
he saw that day by day and step by step
by lusts resisted and by evil shunned
by acts of love and daily duties done
soothing some heartache helping those in need
smoothing life's journey for a brother's feet
guarding the lips from harsh and bitter words
guarding the heart from gross and selfish thoughts
guarding the hands from every evil act
brahman or sudra high or low may rise
till heaven's bright mansions open to the view
and heaven's warm sunshine brightens all the way
while neither hecatombs of victims slain
nor clouds of incense wafted to the skies
nor chanted hymns nor prayers to all the gods
can raise a soul that clings to groveling lusts
he saw the cause of sorrow and its cure
he saw that waves of love surround the soul
as waves of sunlight fill the outer world
while selfishness the subtle alchemist
concealed within changes that love to hate
forges the links of karma's fatal chain
of passions envies lusts to bind the soul
and weaves his webs of falsehood and deceit
to close its windows to the living light
changing its mansion to its prison house
where it must lay self chained and self condemned
while dharma truth the law the living word
brushes away those deftly woven webs
opens its windows to the living light
reveals the architect of all its ills
scatters the timbers of its prison house
and snaps in twain those bitter galling chains
so that the soul once more may stand erect
victor of self no more to be enslaved
and live in charity and gentle peace
bearing all meekly loving those who hate
and when at last the fated stream is reached
with lightened boat to reach the other shore
and here he found the light he long had sought
gilding at once nirvana's blissful heights
and lighting life's sequestered lowly vales
a light whose inner life is perfect love
a love whose outer form is living light
nirvana's sun the light of all the worlds
heart of the universe whose mighty pulse
gives heaven the worlds and even hell their life
maker and father of all living things
matreya's self the lover saviour guide
the last the greatest buddha who must rule
as lord of all before the kalpa's end
the way of life the noble eightfold path
the way of truth the dharma pada found
with joy he bade his loving guides farewell
with joy he turned from all those blissful scenes
and when the rosy dawn next tinged the east
and morning's burst of song had waked the day
with staff and bowl he left the sacred tree
where pilgrims passing pathless mountain heights
and desert sands and ocean's stormy waves
from every nation speaking every tongue
should come in after times to breathe their vows
beginning on that day his pilgrimage
of five and forty years from place to place
breaking the cruel chains of caste and creed
teaching the law of love the way of life

alone on his great mission going forth
down phalgu's valley he retraced his steps
down past the seat where subtle mara sat
and past the fountain where the siren sang
and past the city through the fruitful fields
and gardens he had traversed day by day
for six long years led by a strong desire
to show his brahman teachers his new light
but ah! the change a little time had wrought!
a new made stupa held their gathered dust
while they had gone where all see eye to eye
the darkness vanished and the river crossed
then turning sadly from this hallowed spot
hallowed by strivings for a higher life
more than by dust this little mound contained
he sought beneath the spreading banyan tree
his five companions whom he lately left
sad at his own departure from the way
the sacred vedas and the fathers taught
they too had gone to varanassi gone
high seat and centre of all sacred lore
the day was well nigh spent his cave was near
where he had spent so many weary years
and as he thither turned and upward climbed
the shepherd's little child who watched the flock
his love had rescued from the bloody knife
upon a rock that rose above his path
saw him pass by and ran with eagerness
to bear the news joy filled that humble home
they owed him all the best they had they brought
and offered it with loving gratitude
the master ate and as he ate he taught
these simple souls the great the living truth
that love is more than costly sacrifice
that daily duties done are highest praise
that when life's duties end its sorrows end
and higher joys await the pure in heart
their eager souls drank in his living words
as those who thirst drink in the living spring
then reverently they kissed his garment's hem
and home returned while he lay down to sleep
and sweetly as a babe the master slept
no doubts no darkness and no troubled dreams
when rosy dawn next lit the eastern sky
and morning's grateful coolness filled the air
the master rose and his ablutions made
with bowl and staff in hand he took his way
toward varanassi hoping there to find
the five toward whom his earnest spirit yearned
ten days have passed and now the rising sun
that hangs above the distant mountain peaks
is mirrored back by countless rippling waves
that dance upon the ganges' yellow stream
swollen by rains and melted mountain snows
and glorifies the thousand sacred fanes
with gilded pinnacles and spires and domes
that rise in beauty on its farther bank
while busy multitudes glide up and down
with lightly dipping oars and swelling sails
and pilgrims countless as those shining waves
from far and near from mountain hill and plain
with dust and travel stained foot sore heart sick
here came to bathe within the sacred stream
here came to die upon its sacred banks
seeking to wash the stains of guilt away
seeking to lay their galling burdens down
scoff not at these poor heavy laden souls!
blindly they seek but that all seeing eye
that sees the tiny sparrow when it falls
is watching them his angels hover near
who knows what visions meet their dying gaze
who knows what joys await those troubled hearts
the ancient writings say that having naught
to pay the ferryman the churl refused
to ferry him across the swollen stream
when he was raised and wafted through the air
what matter whether that all powerful love
which moves the worlds and bears with all our sins
sent him a chariot and steeds of fire
or moved the heart of some poor fisherman
to bear him over for a brother's sake
all power is his and men can never thwart
his all embracing purposes of love
now past the stream and near the sacred grove
the deer park called the five saw him approach
but grieved at his departure from the way
the ancient sages taught said with themselves
they would not rise or do him reverence
but as he nearer came the tender love
the holy calm that shone upon his face
made them at once forget their firm resolve
they rose together doing reverence
and bringing water washed his way soiled feet
gave him a mat and said as with one voice
master gautama welcome to our grove
here rest your weary limbs and share our shade
have you escaped from karma's fatal chains
and gained clear vision found the living light
call me not master profitless to you
six years have passed the buddha answered them
in doubt and darkness groping blindly on
but now at last the day has surely dawned
these eyes have seen nirvana's sacred sun
and found the noble eightfold path that mounts
from life's low levels mounts from death's dark shades
to changeless day to never ending rest
then with the prophet's newly kindled zeal
zeal for the truth his opened eyes had seen
zeal for the friends whose struggles he had shared
softened by sympathy and tender love
he taught how selfishness was primal cause
of every ill to which frail flesh is heir
the poisoned fountain whence all sorrows flow
the loathsome worm that coils about the root
and kills the germ of every springing joy
the subtle foe that sows by night the tares
that quickly springing choke the goodly seed
which left to grow would fill the daily life
with balmy fragrance and with precious fruit
he showed that selfishness was life's sole bane
and love its great and sovereign antidote
he showed how selfishness would change the child
from laughing innocence to greedy youth
and heartless manhood cold and cruel age
which past the vale and stript of all disguise
shrinks from the good and eager slinks away
and seeks those dismal regions of the lost
his opened eyes with sinking heart had seen
then showed how love its guardian angel paints
upon the cooing infant's smiling face
grows into gentle youth and manhood rich
in works of helpfulness and brotherhood
and ripens into mellow sweet old age
childhood returned with all its gentleness
whose funeral pile but lights the upward way
to those sweet fields his opened eyes had seen
those ever widening mansions of delight
enwrapt the teacher taught the living truth
enwrapt the hearers heard his living words
the night unheeded winged its rapid flight
the morning found their souls from darkness free
six yellow robes benares daily saw
six wooden alms bowls held for daily food
six meeting sneers with smiles and hate with love
six watchers by the pilgrim's dying bed
six noble souls united in the work
of giving light and hope and help to all
a rich and noble youth an only son
had seen gautama passing through the streets
a holy calm upon his noble face
had heard him tell the pilgrims by the stream
gasping for breath and breathing out their lives
of higher life and joys that never end
and wearied sated by the daily round
of pleasure luxury and empty show
that waste his days but fail to satisfy
yet fearing his companions' gibes and sneers
he sought the master in the sacred grove
when the full moon was mirrored in the stream
the sleeping city silvered by its light
and there he lingered drinking in his words
till night was passed and day was well nigh spent
the father anxious for his absent son
had sought him through the night from street to street
in every haunt that youthful folly seeks
and now despairing sought the sacred grove
perhaps by chance perhaps led by the light
that guides the pigeon to her distant home
and found him there he too the buddha heard
and finding light and filled with joy he said
illustrious master you have found the way
you place the upturned chalice on its base
you fill with light the sayings dark of old
you open blinded eyes to see the truth
at length they thought of those poor hearts at home
mother and sister watching through the night
waiting and watching through the livelong day
startled at every step at every sound
startled at every bier that came in view
in that great city of the stranger dead
that city where the living come to die
and home returned when evening's rose and gold
had faded from the sky and myriad lamps
danced on the sacred stream and moon and stars
hung quivering in its dark and silent depths
but day by day returned eager to hear
more of that truth that sweetens daily life
yet reaches upward to eternal day
a marriage feast three festivals in one
stirs to its depths benares' social life
a gorgeous sunset ushers in the night
sunset and city mirrored in the stream
broad marble steps upon the river bank
lead to a garden where a blaze of bloom
a hedge of rose trees forms the outer wall
an aged banyan tree whose hundred trunks
sustain a vaulted roof of living green
which scarce a ray of noonday's sun can pierce
the garden's vestibule and outer court
while trees of every varied leaf and bloom
shade many winding walks where fountains fall
with liquid cadence into shining pools
above beyond the stately palace stands
inviting in calling to peace and rest
as if a soul dwelt in its marble form
the darkness thickens when a flood of light
fills every recess lighting every nook
the garden hedge a wall of mellow light
a line of lamps along the river's bank
with lamps in every tree and lining every walk
while lamps thick set surround each shining pool
weaving with rainbow tints the falling spray
and now the palace through the darkness shines
a thing of beauty traced with lines of light
the guests arrive in light and graceful boats
in gay gondolas such as venice used
with richest carpets richest canopies
and over walks with rose leaves carpeted
pass to the palace whose wide open gates
display within benares' rank and wealth
proud brahman lords and stately brahman dames
and brahman youth and beauty all were there
of aryan blood but bronzed by india's sun
not dressed like us as very fashion plates
but clothed in flowing robes of softest wool
and finest silk a harmony of shades
sparkling with gems ablaze with precious stones
three noble couples greet their gathering guests
an aged brahman and his aged wife
for fifty years united in the bonds
of wedded love no harsh unloving word
for all those happy years their only fear
that death would break the bonds that bound their souls
and next their eldest born who sought his son
and drank deep wisdom from the buddha's lips
and by his side that mother we have seen
outwatch the night whose sweet and earnest face
by five and twenty years of wedded love
by five and twenty years of busy cares
the cares of home with all its daily joys
had gained that look of holy motherhood
that millions worship on their bended knees
as highest emblem of eternal love
and last that sister whose untiring love
watched by her mother through the weary hours
her fair young face all trust and happiness
before her rainbow tinted hopes and joys
life's dark and cold and cruel side concealed
and by her side a noble brahman youth
who saw in her his every hope fulfilled
but where is now that erring wandering son
the pride of all these loyal loving hearts
heir to this wealth and hope of this proud house
seven clothed in coarsest yellow robes draw near
with heads close shorn and bare unsandaled feet
alms bowl on shoulder slung and staff in hand
but moving with that gentle stateliness
that birth and blood not wealth and effort give
all in the strength of manhood's early prime
all heirs to wealth rejected cast aside
but all united in the holy cause
of giving light and hope and help to all
while earnest greetings from the evening's hosts
show they are welcome and expected guests
startled the stately brahmans turn aside
the heir has lost his reason whispered they
and joined that wandering prince who late appeared
among the yogis in the sacred grove
who thinks he sees the truth by inner sight
who fain would teach the wise and claims to know
more than the fathers and the vedas teach
but as he nearer came his stately form
his noble presence and his earnest face
beaming with gentleness and holy love
hushed into silence every rising sneer
one of their number wise in sacred lore
profoundly learned in all the vedas versed
with courtly grace saluting buddha said
our brahman masters teach that many ways
lead up to brahma loca brahma's rest
as many roads from many distant lands
all meet before benares' sacred shrines
they say that he who learns the vedas' hymns
performs the rites and prays the many prayers
that all the sages of the past have taught
in brahma's self shall be absorbed at last
as all the streams from mountain hill and plain
that swell proud gunga's broad and sacred stream
at last shall mingle with the ocean's waves
they say that brahmans are a holy caste
of whiter skin and higher purer blood
from brahma sprung and brahma's only heirs
while you proclaim if rumor speaks the truth
that only one hard road to brahma leads
that every caste is pure of common blood
that all are brothers all from brahma sprung
but buddha full of gentleness replied
ye call on dyaus pittar brahma god
one god and father called by many names
one god and father seen in many forms
seen in the tempest mingling sea and sky
the blinding sand storm changing day to night
in gentle showers refreshing thirsty fields
seen in the sun whose rising wakes the world
whose setting calls a weary world to rest
seen in the deep o'erarching azure vault
by day a sea of light shining by night
with countless suns of countless worlds unseen
making us seem so little god so great
ye say that brahma dwells in purest light
ye say that brahma's self is perfect love
ye pray to brahma under many names
to give you brahma loca's perfect rest
your prayers are vain unless your hearts are clean
for how can darkness dwell with perfect light
and how can hatred dwell with perfect love
the slandering tongue that stirs up strife and hate
the grasping hand that takes but never gives
the lying lips the cold and cruel heart
whence bitterness and wars and murders spring
can ne'er by prayers to brahma loca climb
the pure in heart alone with brahma dwell
ye say that brahmans are a holy caste
from brahma sprung and brahma's only heirs
but yet in bactria whence our fathers came
and where their brothers and our kindred dwell
no brahman ever wore the sacred cord
has mighty brahma there no son no heir
the brahman mother suffers all the pangs
kshatriyas sudras or the vassas feel
the brahman's body when the soul has fled
a putrid mass defiles the earth and air
vile as the sudras or the lowest beasts
the brahman murderer libertine or thief
ye say will be reborn in lowest beast
while some poor sudra full of gentleness
and pity charity and trust and love
may rise to brahma loca's perfect rest
why boast of caste that seems so little worth
to raise the soul or ward off human ill
why pray for what we do not strive to gain
like merchants on the swollen ganges' bank
praying the farther shore to come to them
taking no steps seeking no means to cross
far better strive to cast out greed and hate
live not for self but live for others' good
indulge no bitter speech no bitter thoughts
help those in need give freely what we have
kill not steal not and ever speak the truth
indulge no lust taste not the maddening bowl
that deadens sense and stirs all base desires
and live in charity and gentle peace
bearing all meekly loving those who hate
this is the way to brahma loca's rest
and ye who may come follow after me
leave wealth and home and all the joys of life
that we may aid a sad and suffering world
in sin and sorrow groping blindly on
becoming poor that others may be rich
wanderers ourselves to lead the wanderers home
and ye who stay ever remember this
that hearth is brahma's altar where love reigns
that house is brahma's temple where love dwells
ye ask my aged friends if death can break
the bonds that bind your souls in wedded love
fear not death has no power to conquer love
go hand in hand till death shall claim his own
then hand in hand ascend nirvana's heights
there hand in hand heart beating close to heart
enter that life whose joys shall never end
perennial youth succeeding palsied age
mansions of bliss for this poor house of clay
labors of love instead of toil and tears
he spoke and many to each other said
why hear this babbler rail at sacred things
our caste our faith our prayers and sacred hymns
and strode away in proud and sovereign scorn
while some with gladness heard his solemn words
all soon forgotten in the giddy whirl
of daily business daily joys and cares
but some drank in his words with eager ears
and asked him many questions lingering long
and often sought him in the sacred grove
to hear his burning words of living truth
and day by day some noble brahman youth
forsook his wealth forsook his home and friends
and took the yellow robe and begging bowl
to ask for alms where all had given him place
meeting with gentleness the rabble's gibes
meeting with smiles the brahman's haughty scorn
thus day by day this school of prophets grew
beneath the banyan's columned vaulted shade
all earnest learners at the master's feet
until the city's busy bustling throng
had come to recognize the yellow robe
the poor to know its wearer as a friend
the sick and suffering as a comforter
while to the dying pilgrim's glazing eyes
he seemed a messenger from higher worlds
come down to raise his sinking spirit up
and guide his trembling steps to realms of rest
a year has passed and of this growing band
sixty are rooted grounded in the faith
willing to do whate'er the master bids
ready to go where'er the master sends
eager to join returning pilgrim bands
and bear the truth to india's farthest bounds
with joy the master saw their burning zeal
so free from selfishness so full of love
and thought of all those blindly groping souls
to whom these messengers would bear the light
go said the master each a different way
go teach the common brotherhood of man
preach dharma preach the law of perfect love
one law for high and low for rich and poor
teach all to shun the cudgel and the sword
and treat with kindness every living thing
teach them to shun all theft and craft and greed
all bitter thoughts and false and slanderous speech
that severs friends and stirs up strife and hate
revere your own revile no brother's faith
the light you see is from nirvana's sun
whose rising splendors promise perfect day
the feeble rays that light your brother's path
are from the selfsame sun by falsehoods hid
the lingering shadows of the passing night
chide none with ignorance but teach the truth
gently as mothers guide their infants' steps
lest your rude manners drive them from the way
that leads to purity and peace and rest
as some rude swain in some sequestered vale
who thinks the visual line that girts him round
the world's extreme would meet with sturdy blows
one rudely charging him with ignorance
yet gently led to some commanding height
whence he could see the himalayan peaks
the rolling hills and india's spreading plains
with joyful wonder views the glorious scene
pause not to break the idols of the past
be guides and leaders not iconoclasts
their broken idols shock their worshipers
but led to light they soon forgotten lie
one of their number young and strong and brave
a merchant ere he took the yellow robe
had crossed the frozen himalayan heights
and found a race alien in tongue and blood
gentle as children in their daily lives
untaught as children in all sacred things
living in wagons wandering o'er the steppes
to day all shepherds tending countless flocks
to morrow warriors cruel as the grave
building huge monuments of human heads
fearless resistless with the cyclone's speed
leaving destruction in their bloody track
who drove the aryan from his native plains
to seek a home in europe's trackless wastes
he yearned to seek these children of the wilds
and teach them peace and gentleness and love
but purna said the master they are fierce
how will you meet their cruelty and wrath
purna replied with gentleness and love
but said the master they may beat and wound
and I will give them thanks to spare my life
but with slow tortures they may even kill
I with my latest breath will bless their names
so soon to free me from this prison house
and send me joyful to the other shore
then said the master purna it is well
armed with such patience seek these savage tribes
thyself delivered free from karma's chains
these souls enslaved thyself consoled console
these restless children of the desert wastes
thyself this peaceful haven having reached
guide these poor wanderers to the other shore
with many counsels many words of cheer
he on their mission sent his brethren forth
armed with a prophet's zeal a brother's love
a martyr's courage and the christian's hope
that when life's duties end its trials end
and higher life awaits those faithful found
the days pass on and now the rising sun
looks down on bands of pilgrims homeward bound
some moving north some south some east some west
toward every part of india's vast expanse
one clothed in orange robes with every band
to guide their kindred on the upward road
but purna joined the merchants he had led
not moved by thirst for gain but love for man
to seek the tartar on his native steppes
meanwhile the master with diminished band
crossing the ganges backward wends his way
toward rajagriha and the vulture peak
where he had spent so many weary years
whither he bade the brothers gather in
when summer's rains should bring the time for rest

northward the noble purna took his way
till india's fields and plains were lost to view
then through the rugged foot hills upward climbed
and up a gorge by rocky ramparts walled
through which a mighty torrent thundered down
their treacherous way along the torrent's brink
or up the giddy cliffs where one false step
would plunge them headlong in the raging stream
passing from cliff to cliff their bridge of ropes
swung high above the dashing roaring waves
at length they cross the frozen mountain pass
o'er wastes of snow by furious tempests swept
and cross a desert where no bird or beast
is ever seen and where their way is marked
by bleaching bones strewn thick along their track
some perished by the way and some turned back
while some of his companions persevered
cheered on by purna's never flagging zeal
and by the master's words from purna's lips
until they reached the outmost wandering tribes
of that great race that he had come to save
with joy received these wandering tribes their guides
for love makes friends where selfishness breeds strife
they soon are led to where their kindred dwell
they saw the vanity of chasing wealth
through hunger danger desolation death
they felt a power sustaining purna's steps
a power unseen yet ever hovering near
they saw the truth of buddha's burning words
that selfishness and greed drag down the soul
while love can nerve the feeblest arm with strength
and asked that purna take them as his aids
but ere brave purna reached his journey's end
near many hamlets many indian towns
the moon high risen to mark the noon of night
through many sacred fig tree's rustling leaves
sent trembling rays with trembling shadows mixed
upon a noble youth in orange robes
his alms bowl by his side stretched out in sleep
dreaming perchance of some benares maid
perchance of home and joys so lately left
meanwhile the master with his little band
toward rajagriha backward wends his way
some village tree their nightly resting place
until they reached the grove that skirts the base
of that bold mountain called the vulture peak
through which the lotus covered phalgu glides
o'erarched with trees festooned with trailing vines
while little streams leap down from rock to rock
cooling the verdant slopes and fragrant glades
and vines and shrubs and trees of varied bloom
loaded the air with odors rich and sweet
and where that sacred fig tree spread its shade
above the mound that held the gathered dust
of those sage brahmans who had sought to aid
the young prince struggling for a clearer light
and where that banyan tree for ages grew
so long the home of those five noble youths
now sundered far some tree when night may fall
their resting place their robe and bowl their all
their only food chance gathered day by day
preaching the common brotherhood of man
teaching the law of universal love
bearing the light to those in darkness sunk
lending a helping hand to those in need
teaching the strong that gentleness is great
and through this grove where many noble souls
were seeking higher life and clearer light
he took his well known way and reached his cave
just as the day was fading into night
and myriad stars spangled the azure vault
and myriad lamps that through the darkness shone
revealed the city that the night had veiled
where soon their weary limbs were laid to rest
but through the silent hour preceding day
before the jungle cock announced the dawn
all roused from sleep in meditation sat
but when the sun had set the east aglow
and roused the birds to sing their matin song's
and roused the lowing herds to call their mates
and roused a sleeping world to daily toil
their matins chanted their ablutions made
with bowl and staff in hand they took their way
down to the city for their daily alms
but earlier steps had brushed their dewy path
from out the shepherd's cottage loving eyes
had recognized the master's stately form
and love winged steps had borne the joyful news
that he the poor man's advocate and friend
the sweet voiced messenger of peace and love
the prince become a beggar for their sake
so long expected now at last returns
from door to door the joyful tidings spread
and old and young from every cottage came
the merchant left his wares without a guard
the housewife left her pitcher at the well
the loom was idle and the anvil still
the money changer told his coins alone
while all the multitude went forth to meet
their servant master and their beggar prince
some brought the garden's choicest treasures forth
some gathered lotuses from phalgu's stream
some climbed the trees to pluck their varied bloom
while children gathered every wayside flower
to strew his way their lover savior guide
king bimbasara from his watch tower saw
the wild commotion and the moving throng
and sent swift messengers to learn the cause
with winged feet through vacant streets they flew
and through the gates and out an avenue
where aged trees that grew on either side
their giant branches interlocked above
made nature's gothic arch and densest shade
while gentle breezes soft as if they came
from devas' hovering wings rustle the leaves
and strew the way with showers of falling bloom
as if they voiceless felt the common joy
and there they found the city's multitudes
not as in tumult armed with clubs and staves
and every weapon ready to their hands
but stretching far on either side the way
their flower filled hands in humble reverence joined
the only sound a murmur there he comes!
while every eye was turned in loving gaze
upon a little band in yellow robes
who now drew near from out the sacred grove
the master passed with calm majestic grace
stately and tall one arm and shoulder bare
with head close shorn and bare unsandaled feet
his noble brow the wonder of his age
not clothed in terror like olympic jove's
for love not anger beamed from out those eyes
changing from clearest blue to softest black
that seem to show unfathomed depths within
with tears of holy pity glittering now
for those poor souls come forth to honor him
all sheep without a shepherd groping on
the messengers with reverence let him pass
then hastened back to tell the waiting king
that he who dwelt so long upon the hill
the prince who stopped the bloody sacrifice
with other holy rishis had returned
whom all received with reverence and joy
the king with keenest pleasure heard their words
that noble form that calm majestic face
had never faded from his memory
his words of wisdom words of tender love
had often stayed his hands when raised to strike
had often put a bridle on his tongue
when harsh and bitter words leaped to his lips
and checked those cruel acts of sudden wrath
that stain the annals of the greatest kings
until the people to each other said
how mild and gentle our good king has grown!
and when he heard this prince had now returned
in flower embroidered purple robes arrayed
with all the pomp and circumstance of state
followed by those who ever wait on power
he issued forth and climbed the rugged hill
until he reached the cave where buddha sat
calm and majestic as the rounded moon
that moves serene along its heavenly path
greeting each other with such royal grace
as fits a prince greeting a brother prince
the king inquired why he had left his home
why he a chakravartin's only son
had left his palace for a lonely cave
wore coarsest cloth instead of royal robes
and for a scepter bore a begging bowl
youth said the king with full and bounding pulse
youth is the time for boon companionship
the time for pleasure when all pleasures please
manhood the time for gaining wealth and power
but as the years creep on the step infirm
the arm grown feeble and the hair turned gray
'tis time to mortify the five desires
to give religion what of life is left
and look to heaven when earth begins to pall
I would not use my power to hold you here
but offer half my kingdom for your aid
to govern well and use my power aright
the prince with gentle earnestness replied
o king illustrious and world renowned!
your noble offer through all coming time
shall be remembered men will praise an act
by likening it to bimbasara's gift
you offer me the half of your domain
I in return beseech you share with me
better than wealth better than kingly power
the peace and joy that follows lusts subdued
wait not on age for age brings feebleness
but this great battle needs our utmost strength
if you will come then welcome to our cave
if not may wisdom all your actions guide
ruling your empire in all righteousness
preserve your country and protect her sons
sadly I leave you great and gracious king
but my work calls a world that waits for light
in yonder sacred grove three brothers dwell
kasyapa gada nadi they are called
three chosen vessels for the perfect law
three chosen lamps to light a groping world
who worship now the gross material fire
which burns and wastes but fails to purify
I go to tell them of nirvana's sun
perennial source of that undying flame
the fire of love consuming lust and hate
as forest fires devour the crackling thorns
until the soul is purified from sin
and sorrow birth and death are left behind
he found kasyapa as the setting sun
was sinking low behind the western hills
and somber shadows darkened phalgu's vale
and asked a place to pass the gathering night
here is a grotto cooled by trickling streams
and overhanging shades fit place for sleep
kasyapa said that I would gladly give
but some fierce naga nightly haunts the spot
whose poisoned breath no man can breathe and live
fear not for me the buddha answered him
for I this night will make my dwelling there
do as you will kasyapa doubtful said
but much I fear some dire catastrophe
now mighty mara spirit of the air
the prince of darkness roaming through the earth
had found this grotto in the sacred grove
and as a naga there kept nightly watch
for those who sought deliverance from his power
who when the master calmly took his seat
belched forth a flood of poison foul and black
and with hot burning vapors filled the cave
but buddha sat unmoved serene and calm
as brahma sits amid the kalpa fires
that burn the worlds but cannot harm his heaven
while mara knowing buddha fled amazed
and left the naga coiled in buddha's bowl
kasyapa terrified beheld the flames
and when the first faint rays of dawn appeared
with all his fearful followers sought the cave
and found the master not consumed to dust
but full of peace aglow with perfect love
kasyapa full of wonder joyful said
I though a master have no power like this
to conquer groveling lusts and evil beasts
then buddha taught the source of real power
the power of love to fortify the soul
until kasyapa gathered all his stores
his sacred vessels sacrificial robes
and cast them in the phalgu passing near
his brothers saw them floating down the stream
and winged with fear made haste to learn the cause
they too the master saw and heard his words
and all convinced received the perfect law
and with their followers joined the buddha's band
the days pass on and in the bamboo grove
a great vihara as by magic rose
built by the king for buddha's growing band
a spacious hall where all might hear his words
and little cells where each might take his rest
a school and rest house through the summer rains
but soon the monsoons from the distant seas
bring gathering clouds to veil the brazen sky
while nimble lightnings dart their blinding flames
and rolling thunders shake the trembling hills
and heaven's downpourings drench the thirsty earth
the master's seed time when the people rest
for now the sixty from their distant fields
have gathered in to trim their lamps afresh
and learn new wisdom from the master's lips
all but brave purna on the tartar steppes
where summer is the fittest time for toil
when india's rains force india's sons to rest
the new vihara and the bamboo grove
king bimbasara to the master gave
where day by day he taught his growing school
while rills grown torrents leap from rock to rock
and phalgu's swollen stream sweeps down the vale
that saraputra after called the great
had seen these new come youths in yellow robes
passing from street to street to ask for alms
receiving coarsest food with gentle thanks
had seen them meet the poor and sick and old
with kindly words and ever helpful hands
had seen them passing to the bamboo grove
joyful as bridegrooms soon to meet their brides
he vashpa and asvajit met one day
whom he had known beneath the banyan tree
two of the five who first received the law
now clothed in yellow bearing begging bowls
and asked their doctrine who their master was
that they seemed joyful while within the grove
all seemed so solemn self absorbed and sad
they bade him come and hear the master's words
and when their bowls were filled he followed them
and heard the living truth from buddha's lips
and said the sun of wisdom has arisen
what further need of our poor flickering lamps
and with mugallan joined the master's band
and now five strangers from the tartar steppes
strangers in form and features language dress
guided by one as strange in dress as they
weary and foot sore passed within the gates
of rajagriha while the rising sun
was still concealed behind the vulture peak
a laughing stock to all the idle crowd
whom noisy children followed through the streets
as thoughtless children follow what is strange
until they met the master asking alms
who with raised hand and gentle mild rebuke
hushed into silence all their noisy mirth
these are our brothers buddha mildly said
weary and worn they come from distant lands
and ask for kindness not for mirth and jeers
they knew at once that calm majestic face
that voice as sweet as brahma's and those eyes
beaming with tender all embracing love
of which while seated round their argol fires
in their black tents brave purna loved to tell
and bowed in worship at the master's feet
he bade them rise and learned from whence they came
and led them joyful to the bamboo grove
where some brought water from the nearest stream
to bathe their festered feet and weary limbs
while some brought food and others yellow robes
fitter for india's heat than skins and furs
all welcoming their new found friends who came
from distant lands o'er desert wastes and snows
to see the master hear the perfect law
and bring the message noble purna sent
the months pass on the monsoons cease to blow
the thunders cease to roll the rains to pour
the earth refreshed is clothed with living green
and flowers burst forth where all was parched and bare
and busy toil succeeds long days of rest
the time for mission work has come
the brethren now to many hundreds grown
where'er the master thought it best were sent
the strongest and the bravest volunteered
to answer purna's earnest call for help
and clothed in fitting robes for piercing cold
they scale the mountains pass the desert wastes
their guide familiar with their terrors grown
while some return to their expectant flocks
and some are sent to kindred lately left
and some to strangers dwelling near or far
all bearing messages of peace and love
until but few in yellow robes remain
and single footfalls echo through that hall
where large assemblies heard the master's words
a few are left not yet confirmed in faith
and those five brothers from the distant north
remain to learn the sacred tongue and lore
while saraputra and kasyapa stay
to aid the master in his special work
from far kosala rich sudata came
friend of the destitute and orphans called
in houses rich and rich in lands and gold
but richer far in kind and gracious acts
who stopped in rajagriha with a friend
but when he learned a buddha dwelt so near
and heard the gracious doctrine he proclaimed
that very night he sought the bamboo grove
while roofs and towers were silvered by the moon
and silent streets in deepest shadows lay
and bamboo plumes seemed waving silver sprays
and on the ground the trembling shadows played
humble in mind but great in gracious deeds
of earnest purpose but of simple heart
the master saw in him a vessel fit
for righteousness and bade him stay and learn
his rules of grace that bring nirvana's rest
and first of all the gracious master said
this restless nature and this selfish world
is all a phantasy and empty show
its life is lust its end is pain and death
waste not your time in speculations deep
of whence and why one thing we surely know
each living thing must have a living cause
and mind from mind and not from matter springs
while love which like an endless golden chain
binds all in one is love in every link
up from the sparrow's nest the mother's heart
through all the heavens to brahma's boundless love
and lusts resisted daily duties done
unite our lives to that unbroken chain
which draws us up to heaven's eternal rest
and through the night they earnestly communed
until sudata saw the living truth
in rising splendor like the morning sun
and doubts and errors all are swept away
as gathering clouds are swept by autumn's winds
bowing in reverence sudata said
I know the buddha never seeks repose
but gladly toils to give to others rest
o that my people now in darkness sunk
might see the light and hear the master's words!
I dwell in king pasenit's distant realm
a king renowned a country fair and rich
and yearn to build a great vihara there
the master knowing well sudata's heart
and his unselfish charity replied
some give in hope of greater gifts returned
some give to gain a name for charity
some give to gain the rest and joy of heaven
some to escape the woes and pains of hell
such giving is but selfishness and greed
but he who gives without a selfish thought
has entered on the noble eightfold path
is purified from anger envy hate
the bonds of pain and sorrow are unloosed
the way to rest and final rescue found
let your hands do what your kind heart desires
hearing this answer he departs with joy
and buddha with him saraputra sent
arriving home he sought a pleasant spot
and found the garden of pasenit's son
and sought the prince seeking to buy the ground
but he refused to sell yet said in jest
cover the grove with gold the ground is yours
forthwith sudata spread his yellow coin
but gata said caught by his thoughtless jest
spread not your gold I will not sell the ground
not sell the ground sudata sharply said
why then said you 'fill it with yellow gold'
and both contending sought a magistrate
but gata knowing well his earnestness
asked why he sought the ground and when he learned
he said keep half your gold the land is yours
but mine the trees and jointly we will build
a great vihara for the buddha's use
the work begun was pressed both night and day
lofty it rose in just proportions built
fit for the palace of a mighty king
the people saw this great vihara rise
a stately palace for a foreign prince
and said in wonder what strange thing is this
our king to welcome thus a foreign king
to new made palaces and not with war
and bloody spears and hands to new made graves
as was his father's wont in times gone by
yet all went forth to meet this coming prince
and see a foreign monarch's royal pomp
but heard no trumpeting of elephants
nor martial music nor the neigh of steeds
but saw instead a little band draw near
in yellow robes with dust and travel stained
but love that like a holy halo crowned
that dusty leader's calm majestic brow
hushed into silence every rising sneer
and when sudata met this weary band
and to the prince's garden led their way
they followed on their hands in reverence joined
to where the stately new vihara rose
enbowered in giant trees of every kind
that india's climate grows while winding streams
along their flowery banks now quiet flow
now leap from rocks now spread in shining pools
with lotuses and lilies overspread
while playing fountains with their falling spray
spread grateful coolness and a blaze of bloom
from myriad opening flowers perfumes the air
and myriad birds that sought this peaceful spot
burst forth in every sweet and varied song
that india's fields and groves and gardens know
and there sudata bowed on bended knee
and from a golden pitcher water poured
the sign and sealing of their gift of love
of this vihara gatavana called
a school and rest house for the buddha's use
and for the brotherhood throughout the world
buddha received it with the fervent prayer
that it might give the kingdom lasting peace
unlike sudata's self sudata's king
believed religion but a comely cloak
to hide besetting sins from public view
and sought the master in his new retreat
to talk religion and to act a part
and greetings ended said in solemn wise
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
but my poor kingdom now is doubly blest
in one whose teachings purify the soul
and give the highest and the humblest rest
as all are cleansed who bathe in rapti's stream
but buddha saw through all this outer show
his real purposes and inner life
the love of pleasure blighting high resolve
the love of money root of every ill
that sends its poison fibers through the soul
and saps its life and wastes its vital strength
the tathagata only shows the way
to purity and rest the master said
there is a way to darkness out of light
there is a way to light from deepest gloom
they only gain the goal who keep the way
harsh words and evil deeds to sorrow lead
as sure as shadows on their substance wait
for as we sow so also shall we reap
boast not overmuch of kingly dignity
a king most needs a kind and loving heart
to love his subjects as an only son
to aid not injure comfort not oppress
their help protector father friend and guide
such kings shall live beloved and die renowned
whose works shall welcome them to heavenly rest
the king convicted heard his solemn words
that like an arrow pierced his inmost life
to him religion ceased to be a show
of chants and incense empty forms and creeds
but stood a living presence in his way
to check his blind and headlong downward course
and lead him to the noble eightfold path
that day by day and step by step shall lead
to purity and peace and heavenly rest
kapilavastu's king suddhodana
his step grown feeble snowy white his hair
by cares oppressed and sick with hope deferred
for eight long years had waited for his son
but sweet yasodhara in widow's weeds
her love by sorrow only purified
as fire refines the gold by dross debased
though tender memories bring unbidden tears
wasted no time in morbid selfish grief
but sought in care for others her own cure
both son and daughter to the aged king
she aids with counsels soothes with tender care
father and mother to her little son
she lavishes on him a double love
and oft on mercy's missions going forth
shunning the pomp and show of royal state
leading rahula prattling by her side
the people saw her pass with swelling hearts
as if an angel clothed in human form
and now strange rumors reach the public ear
by home bound pilgrims from benares brought
and merchantmen from rajagriha come
that there a holy rishi had appeared
whom all believed a very living buddh
while kings and peoples followed after him
these rumors reached the sweet yasodhara
and stirred these musings in her watchful heart
stately and tall they say this rishi is
gentle to old and young to rich and poor
and filled with love for every living thing
but who so gentle stately tall and grand
as my siddartha who so full of love
and he has found the light siddartha sought!
it must be he my own my best beloved!
and surely he will hither come and bring
to his poor people now in darkness sunk
that living light he left his home to seek
as the same sun that makes the cedars grow
and sends their vital force through giant oaks
clothes fields with green and decks the wayside flower
and crowns the autumn with its golden fruits
so that same love which swept through buddha's soul
and drove him from his home to seek and save
warmed into brighter glow each lesser love
of home and people father wife and child
and often through those long and troubled years
he felt a burning longing to return
and now when summer rains had ceased to fall
and his disciples were again sent forth
both love and duty with united voice
bade him revisit his beloved home
and saraputra and kasyapa joined
the master wending on his homeward way
while light winged rumor bore yasodhara
this joyful news the holy rishi comes
without the southern gate a garden lay
lumbini called by playing fountains cooled
with shaded walks winding by banks of flowers
whose mingled odors load each passing breeze
thither yasodhara was wont to go
for there her lord and dearest love was born
and there they passed full many happy days
the southern road skirted this garden's wall
while on the other side were suburb huts
where toiling poor folk and the base born dwell
and near this wall a bright pavilion rose
whence she could see each passer by the way
one morning after days of patient watch
she saw approach along this dusty road
three seeming pilgrims clothed in yellow robes
presenting at each humble door their bowls
for such poor food as these poor folk could give
as they drew near a growing multitude
from every cottage swelled followed their steps
gazing with awe upon the leader's face
while each to his companion wondering said
who ever saw a rishi such as this
who calls us brothers whom the brahmans scorn
but sweet yasodhara with love's quick sight
knew him she waited for and forth she rushed
crying siddartha o my love! my lord!
and prostrate in the dust she clasped his feet
he gently raised and pressed her to his heart
in one most tender loving long embrace
by that embrace her every heartache cured
she calmly said give me a humble part
in your great work for though my hands are weak
my heart is strong and my weak hands can bear
the cooling cup to fever's burning lips
my mother's heart has more than room enough
for many outcasts many helpless waifs
and there in presence of that base born throng
who gazed with tears and wonder on the scene
and in a higher presence who can doubt
he made her first of that great sisterhood
since through the ages known in every land
who gently raise the dying soldier's head
where cruel war is mangling human limbs
who smooth the pillow bathe the burning brow
of sick and helpless strangers taken in
whose tender care has made the orphans' home
for those poor waifs who know no mother's love
then toward the palace they together went
to their rahula and the aged king
while streets were lined and doors and windows filled
with eager gazers at the prince returned
in coarsest robes with closely shaven head
returned a buddha who went forth a prince
through all these troubled weary waiting years
the king still hoped to see his son return
in royal state with kings for waiting men
to rule a willing world as king of kings
but now that son enters his palace gates
in coarsest beggar garb his alms bowl filled
with sudras' leavings for his daily food
the king with mingled grief and anger said
is this the end of all our cherished hopes
the answer to such lofty prophecies
to see the heir of many mighty king's
enter his kingdom like a beggar tramp
this the return for all the patient love
of sweet yasodhara and this the way
to teach his duty to your royal son
the prince with reverence kissed his father's hand
bent loving eyes upon his troubled brow
that banished all his bitterness and said
how hard it is to give up cherished hopes
I know full well I know a father's love
your love for me I for rahula feel
and who can better know that deepest love
whose tendrils round my very heartstrings twine!
but crores of millions with an equal love
fathers and mothers children husbands wives
in doubt and darkness groping blindly on
cry out for help not lack of love for you
or my rahula or yasodhara
but love for them drove me to leave my home
the greatest kingdoms are like ocean's foam
a moment white upon the crested wave
the longest life is but a passing dream
whose changing scenes but fill a moment's space
but these poor souls shall live in joy or woe
while nations rise and fall and kalpas pass
and this proud city crumbles to decay
till antiquarians search its site in vain
and beasts shall burrow where this palace stands
not for the pleasures of a passing day
like shadows flitting ere you point their place
not for the transient glories of a king
now clothed in scarlet but to morrow dust
can I forget those loving living souls
groping in darkness vainly asking help
and then he showed the noble eightfold path
from life's low levels to nirvana's heights
while king and people on the master gazed
whose face beaming with pure unselfish love
transfigured seemed and many noble youth
and chief ananda the beloved called
forsook their gay companions and the round
of youthful sports and joined the master's band
and as he spoke crores more than mortals saw
gathered to hear and king suddhodana
and sweet yasodhara entered the path
