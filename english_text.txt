there belongs to every human being a higher self and a lower self
a self or mind of the spirit which has been growing for ages and a self of the body which is but a thing of yesterday
the higher self is full of prompting idea suggestion and aspiration
this it receives of the supreme power
all this the lower or animal self regards as wild and visionary
the higher self argues possibilities and power for us greater than men and women now possess and enjoy
the lower self says we can only live and exist as men and women have lived and existed before us
the higher self craves freedom from the cumbrousness the limitations the pains and disabilities of the body
the lower self says that we are born to them born to ill born to suffer and must suffer as have so many before us
the higher self wants a standard for right and wrong of its own
the lower self says we must accept a standard made for us by others
by general and long held opinion belief and prejudice
to thine own self be true is an oft uttered adage
but to which self
the higher or lower
you have in a sense two minds
the mind of the body and the mind of the spirit
spirit is a force and a mystery
all we know or may ever know of it is that it exists and is ever working and producing all results in physical things seen of physical sense and many more not so seen
what is seen of any object a tree an animal a stone a man is only a part of that tree animal stone or man
there is a force which for a time binds such objects together in the form you see them
that force is always acting on them to greater or lesser degree
it builds up the flower to its fullest maturity
its cessation to act on the flower or tree causes what we call decay
it is constantly changing the shape of all forms of what are called organized matter
an animal a plant a human being are not in physical shape this month or this year what they will be next month or next year
this ever acting ever varying force which lies behind and in a sense creates all forms of matter we call spirit
to see reason and judge of life and things in the knowledge of this force makes what is termed the spiritual mind
we have through knowledge the wonderful power of using or directing this force when we recognize it and know that it exists so as to bring us health happiness and eternal peace of mind
composed as we are of this force we are ever attracting more of it to us and making it a part of our being
with more of this force must come more and more knowledge
at first in our physical existences we allow it to work blindly
then we are in the ignorance of that condition known as the material mind
but as mind through its growth or increase of this power becomes more and more awakened it asks
why comes so much of pain grief and disappointment in the physical life
why do we seem born to suffer and decay
that question is the first awakening cry of the spiritual mind and an earnest question or demand for knowledge must in time be answered
the material mind is a part of yourself which has been appropriated by the body and educated by the body
it is as if you taught a child that the wheels of a steamboat made the boat move and said nothing of the steam which gives the real power
bred in such ignorance the child should the wheels stop moving would look no farther for the cause of their stoppage than to try to find where to repair them very much as now so many depend entirely on repair of the physical body to ensure its healthy vigorous movement never dreaming that the imperfection lies in the real motive power
the mind
the mind of the body or material mind sees thinks and judges entirely from the material or physical standpoint
it sees in your own body all there is of you
the spiritual mind sees the body as an instrument for the mind or real self to use in dealing with material things
the material mind sees in the death of the body an end of all there is of you
the spiritual mind sees in the death of the body only the falling off from the spirit of a worn out instrument
it knows that you exist as before only invisible to the physical eye
the material mind sees your physical strength as coming entirely from your muscles and sinews and not from source without your body
it sees in such persuasive power as you may have with tongue or pen the only force you possess for dealing with people to accomplish results the spiritual mind will know in time that your thought influences people for or against your interests though their bodies are thousands of miles distant
the material mind does not regard its thought as an actual element as real as air or water
the spiritual mind knows that every one of its thousand daily secret thoughts are real things acting on the minds of the persons they are sent to
the spiritual mind knows that matter or the material is only an expression of spirit or force
that such matter is ever changing in accordance with the spirit that makes or externalizes itself in the form we call matter and therefore if the thought of health strength and recuperation is constantly held to in the mind such thought of health strength and rejuvenation will express itself in the body making maturity never ceasing vigor never ending and the keenness of every physical sense ever increasing
the material mind thinks matter or that which is known by our physical senses to be the largest part of what exists
the spiritual mind regards matter as the coarser or cruder expression of spirit and the smallest part of what really exists
the material mind is made sad at the contemplation of decay
the spiritual mind attaches little importance to decay knowing in such decay that spirit or the moving force in all things is simply taking the dead body or the rotten tree to pieces and that it will build them up again as before temporarily into some other new physical form of life and beauty
the mind of the body thinks that its physical senses of seeing hearing and feeling constitute all the senses you possess
the higher mind or mind of the spirit knows that it possesses other senses akin to those of physical sight and hearing but more powerful and far reaching
the mind of the body has been variously termed the material mind the mortal mind and the carnal mind
all these refer to the same mind or in other words to that part of your real sell which has been educated in error by the body
if you had been born and bred entirely among people who believed that the earth was a flat surface and did not revolve around the sun you would in the earlier years of your physical growth believe as they did
exactly in such fashion do you in your earlier years absorb the thought and belief of those nearest you who think that the body is all there is of them and judge of everything by its physical interpretation to them
this makes your material mind
the material mind seeing what seems to it depth dissolution and decay in all human organization and ignorant of the fact that the real self or intelligence has in such seeming death only cast off a worn out envelope thinks that decay and death is the ultimate of all humanity
for such reason it cannot avoid a gloom or sadness coming of such error which now pervades so much of human life at present
one result or reaction from such gloom born of hopelessness is a reckless spirit for getting every possible gratification and pleasure regardless of right and justice so long as the present body lasts
this is a great mistake
all pleasure so gained cannot be lasting
it brings besides a hundredfold more misery and disappointment
the spiritual mind teaches that pleasure is the great aim of existence
but it points out ways and means for gaining lasting happiness other than those coming of the teaching of the material mind
the spiritual mind or mind opened to higher and newer forces of life teaches that there is a law regulating the exercise of every physical sense
when we learn and follow this law our gratifications and possessions do not prove sources of greater pain than happiness as they do to so many
by the spiritual mind is meant a clearer mental sight of things and forces existing both in us and the universe and of which the race for the most part has been in total ignorance
we have now but a glimpse of these forces those of some being relatively a little clearer than those of others
but enough has been shown to convince a few that the real and existing causes for humanity’s sickness sorrow and disappointment have not in the past been seen at all
in other words the race has been as children fancying that the miller inside was turning the arms of the windmill because some person had so told them
so taught they would remain in total ignorance that the wind was the motive power
this illustration is not at all an overdrawn picture of the existing ignorance which rejects the idea that thought is an element all about us as plentiful as air and that as blindly directed by individuals and masses of individuals in the domain of material mind or ignorance it is turning the windmill’s arms sometimes in one direction sometimes in another
sometimes with good and sometimes with evil results
a suit of clothes is not the body that wears such suit
yet the material mind reasons very much in this way
it knows of no such thing as clothing for the spirit for it does not know that body and spirit are two distinct things
it reasons that the suit of clothing the body is all there is of the man or woman
when that man or woman tumbles to pieces through weakness it sees only the suit of clothes so going to pieces and all its efforts to make that man or woman stronger are put on the suit instead of making effort to reinforce the power within which has made the suit
there are probably no two individuals precisely alike as regards the relative condition or action on them of their material and spiritual minds
with some the spiritual seems not at all awakened
with others it has begun to stretch and rub its eyes as a person does on physical awakening when everything still appears vague and indistinct
others are more fully awakened
they feel to greater or lesser extent that there are forces belonging to them before unthought of
it is with such that the struggle for mastery between the material and spiritual mind is likely to be most severe and such struggle for a time is likely to be accompanied by physical disturbance pain or lack of ease
the material mind is until won over and convinced of the truths constantly received by the spiritual mind at war and in opposition to it the ignorant part of yourself dislikes very much to give up its long accustomed habits of thinking
its costs a struggle in any case at first to own that we have been mistaken and give up views long held to
the material mind wants to more on in a rut of life and idea as it always has done and as thousands are now doing
it dislikes change more and more as the crust of the old thought held from year to year grows more thickly over it
it wants to live on and on in the house it has inhabited for years
dress in the fashion of the past
go to business and return year in and year out at precisely the same hour
it rejects and despises after a certain age the idea of learning any new accomplishments such as painting or music whose greatest use is to divert the mind rest it and enable you to live in other departments of being all this being apart from the pleasure also given you as the mind or spirit teaches the body more and more skill and expertness in the art you pursue
the material mind sees as the principal use of any art only a means to bring money and not in such art a means for giving variety to life dispelling weariness resting that portion of the mind devoted to other business improving health and increasing vigour of mind and body
it holds to the idea of being too old to learn
this is the condition of so many persons who have arrived at or are past middle age
they want to settle down
they accept as inevitable the idea of growing old
their material mind tells them that their bodies must gradually weaken shrink from the fullness and proportion of youth decay and finally die
material minds say this always has been and therefore always must be
they accept the idea wholly
they say quite unconsciously it must be
to say a thing must be is the very power that makes it
the material mind then sees the body ever as gradually decaying even though it dislikes the picture and puts it out of sight as much as possible
but the idea will recur from time to time as suggested by the death of their contemporaries and as it does they think must and that state of mind indicated by the word must will inevitably bring material results in decay
the spiritual or more enlightened mind says
if you would help to drive away sickness turn your thought as much as you can on health strength and vigour and on strong healthy vigorous material things such as moving clouds fresh breezes the cascade the ocean surge
on woodland scenes and growing healthy trees
on birds full of life and motion
for in so doing you turn on yourself a real current or this healthy life giving thought which is suggested and brought you by the thought of such vigorous strong material objects
and above all try to rely and trust that supreme power which formed all these things and far more and which is the endless and inexhaustible part of your higher self or spiritual mind and as your faith increases in this power so will your own power ever increase
nonsense! says the ultra material mind
if my body is sick I must have something done to cure that body with things I can see and feel and that is the only thing to be done
as for thinking it makes no difference what I think sick or well
at present in such a case a mind whose sense of these truths new to it has just commenced to be awakened will in many cases allow itself to be for a time overpowered and ridiculed out of such an idea by its own material mind or uneducated part of itself
and in this it is very likely to be assisted by other material minds who have not woke up at all to these truths and who are temporarily all the stronger through the positiveness of ignorance
these are as people who cannot see as far ahead as one may with a telescope and who may be perfectly honest in their disbelief regarding what the person with the telescope does see
though such people do not speak a word or argue against the belief of the partly awakened mind still their thought acts on such a mind as a bar or blind to these glimpses of the truth
but when the spiritual mind has once commenced to awaken nothing can stop its further waking though the material may for a time retard it
your real self may not at times be where your body is says the spiritual mind
it is where your mind is
in the store the office the workshop or with some person to whom you are strongly attached and all of these may be in towns or cities far from the one your body resides in
your real self moves with inconceivable rapidity as your thought moves
‘‘nonsense says your material mind
I myself am wherever my body is and nowhere else
many a thought or idea that you reject as visionary or as a whim or fancy comes of the prompting of your spiritual mind
it is your material mind that rejects it
no such idea comes but that there is a truth in it
but that truth we may not be able to carry out to a relative perfection immediately
two hundred years ago some mind may have seen the use of steam as a motive power
but that motive power could not then have been carried out as it is today
a certain previous growth was necessary
a growth and improvement in the manufacture of iron in the construction of roads and in the needs of the people
but the idea was a truth
held to by various minds it has brought steam as a motive power to its present relative perfection
it has struggled against and overcome every argument and obstacle placed in its way by dull material plodding minds
when you entertain any idea and say to yourself in substance
well such a thing may be though I cannot now see it you remove a great barrier to the carrying out and realization by yourself of the new and strange possibilities in store for you
the spiritual mind today sees belonging to itself a power for accomplishing any and all results in the physical world greater than the masses dream of
it sees that as regards life’s possibilities we are still in dense ignorance
it sees however a few things
namely perfect health freedom from decay weakness and death of the body power of transit travel and observation independent of the body and methods for obtaining all needful and desirable material things through the action and working of silent mind or thought either singly or in co operation with others
the condition of mind to be desired is the entire dominancy of the spiritual mind
but this does not imply dominancy or control in any sense of tyrannical mastership of the material mind by the spiritual mind
it does imply that the material mind will be swept away so far as its stubborn resistance and opposition to the promptings of the spiritual are concerned
it implies that the body will become the willing servant or rather assistant of the spirit
it implies that the material mind will not endeavour to act itself up as the superior when it is only the inferior
it implies that state when the body will gladly lend its co operation to all the desires of the spiritual mind
then all power can be given your spirit
then no force need be expended in resisting the hostility of the material mind
then all such force will be used to further our undertakings to bring us material goods to raise us higher and higher into realms of power peace and happiness to accomplish what now would be called miracles
neither the material mind nor the material body is to be won over and merged into the spiritual by any course of severe self censure or self denial nor self punishment in expiation for sins committed nor asceticism
that will only make you the more harsh severe bigoted and merciless both to yourself and others
it is out of this perversion of the truth that have arisen such terms as crucifying the body and subjugating the lower or animal mind
it is from this perversion that have come orders and associations of men and women who going to another extreme seek holiness in self denial and penance
holiness implies wholeness or whole action of the spirit on the body or perfect control by your spirit over a body through knowledge and faith in our capacity to draw ever more and more from the supreme power
when you get out of patience with yourself through the aggressiveness of the material mind through your frequent slips and falls into your besetting sins through periods of petulance or ill temper or excess in any direction you do no good and only ill in calling or thinking for yourself hard names
you should not call yourself a vile sinner anymore than you would call any other person a vile sinner if you do you put out in thought the vile sinner and make it temporarily a reality
if in your mental vision you teach yourself that you are utterly depraved and a vile sinner you are unconsciously making that your ideal and you will unconsciously grow up to it until the pain and evil coming of such unhealthy growth either makes you turn back or destroys your body for out of this state of mind which in the past has been much inculcated comes harshness bigotry lack of charity for others hard stern and gloomy and unhealthy views of life and these mental conditions will surely bring physical disease
when the material mind is put away or in other words then we become convinced of the existence of these spiritual forces both in ourselves and outside of ourselves and when we learn to use them rightly for we are now and always have been using them in some way then to use the words of paul
faith is swallowed up in victory and the sting and fear of death is removed
life becomes then one glorious advance forward from the pleasure of today to the greater pleasure of tomorrow and the phrase to live means only to enjoy
who are our relations
the man or woman who if most like you in tastes motives and habits of thought and to whom you feel most attracted may not be brother sister cousin or any physical relative at all
but such person is to you a very near relation
your brothers or sisters may not be like you at all in mind taste and inclination
you may associate with them because they are members of the family but were you not to know them as brothers sisters or other relatives or were you to see elsewhere their exact counterparts in character you might not like such counterparts at all
physical or blood relationship has very little bearing on the real or mental relationship
it is possible for a brother or sister a father or mother to be very closely allied to you in thought and sympathy
again it is possible for a father or mother brother or sister to be very remote from you in thought and sympathy and to live in a realm or atmosphere of thought very unlike yours
you can live neither healthfully nor comfortably unless with those whose thought atmosphere a literal emanation from them is similar to your own
physical relationship may or may not furnish such at atmosphere
compel a labouring man whose thought goes little beyond his eating drinking and daily round of work to live exclusively with a company of artists and philosophers seeing none of his own kind and order of thought and that man’s spirits would in time be depressed and his health would suffer
the same law works when the superior mind is compelled to constant association with the inferior
such may be your position among physical relatives
children live thrive and are exhilarated by the thought atmosphere emanating from their playmates
cut them entirely off from such association and they droop
as a child you lived upon this atmosphere of childhood
that is you lived in the spiritual relationship of childhood and regarding a certain playful thought nutriment received it and also gave it to your playmates
you may wonder now why you cannot arouse the old feeling and exhilaration coming either from the associations of childhood or youth
it is because your spirit requires another thought food or atmosphere which only another and probably higher order of mind can give
that received and time would pass as quickly and pleasantly as it did with the associates of your earlier physical existence
those who can furnish it are your real relations
but such relationship cannot exist unless you can furnish them with the same quality of thought in return
the real or spiritual relations of many merchants mechanics and those of other callings are their brother merchants mechanics or those of similar occupations
they prove this by their lives
they feel more at home with those whose business is like their own than they do in the places they may call home to which they resort to eat sleep and spend often a tiresome sunday longing for monday’s coming and the more welcome life of the market stall and store
because there they are amongst their real relations and are being literally led and stimulated by the thought  atmosphere furnished them by these relatives which they also furnish in turn
every order of mind or quality of thought must have association with a corresponding order of mind and quality of thought or it will suffer
but ‘‘blood relationship has little to do with furnishing such order of thought
there is a vast amount of unconscious tyranny exercised through the ties of physical relationship
children often when grown up place the mothers or fathers in their minds in a sphere and method of life where they may or may not care to belong
then thought seldom if ever expressed runs in substance thus
mother is getting too old to wear bright colours
she must dress more subdued
it is ridiculous for mother if a widow to marry again very hard cash reasons sometimes entering into this sentiment
mother of course does not want to enter into our gayer life so she can stay at home and take care of the children
or it is time father retired from business or father’s idea of marrying again is ridiculous
no force is more subtle in its workings nor more powerful to bring results for good or ill than the steady output of thought from one or several minds combined on one person to effect some desired result and whether this is done intelligently and consciously or blindly the force works the same result
now a continual flow of this kind of thought coming from possibly three or four minds to whom mother was instrumental in furnishing new bodies and continually directed on mother is a very powerful force to direct and keep her exactly where the children find it most convenient to have her
the whole conventional current of thought also flows as an aid in this direction
mother says this unspoken sentiment must of course grow old retire gradually from a more active and gayer life and retire also to a corner of the household to associate with other shelved and declining parents and he useful as a general upper nurse in times of sickness or other family emergency
’’ through the action on her on these minds many mothers cease to have any privileges as individuals and eventually do exactly as their children desire
possibly it is here remarked or thought but should I not go to my mother or other near relative with my cares and trials and receive her help as I have always been in the habit of doing
ought not those of my own family above all others to help me in time of need
certainly if the mother or any of your physical relatives are glad and anxious so to do
certainly if such service from a relative comes directly from the heart and is not impelled by the sentiment taking sometimes this form of unspoken expression
I suppose I must do this because it is my brother or my son or other physical relative who asks it
’’ asks it
many many are these services which are unconsciously demanded rather than asked in these cases
loads are piled upon relatives simply becausethey are relatives
favours in money
in the endorsement of notes are in a sense exacted through sympathy of relatives
support food shelter maintenance are expected from relatives when it cannot be procured elsewhere
hospitality is expected from relatives when to expect hospitality is to make such entertainment the result of a demand
presents are expected from relatives when to expect a gift makes it rather an extortion
real gifts are always surprises
no one expects a surprise since expectation destroys surprise
relatives visit and camp down on other relatives simply because they are relatives and a vast amount of grudging grumbling but unspoken thought is always going out when relatives use each other’s houses to save hotel bills
no real or lasting good comes of any gift bestowed on another unless the heart goes with it and its bestowal is to the giver an act of unalloyed pleasure
because something else goes with the material gift the food the shelter the loan which though not seen and little known is more important than the form itself
that is the thought which goes with it which thought strongly affects for good or ill the person who receives the gift
if as giving within your means you bestow the merest trifle in money upon a person in need and the thought that goes with it is not only the most sincere desire to help that person but you feel a keen sense of pleasure in giving such help then you throw upon that person a certain thought element which will never leave them and benefit them eternally and in proportion to the quality power and force of your thought
then you do far more than relieve their present physical necessity
you give them a certain amount of spiritual power
your wish that their power may be so developed and increased as to enable them to live above beggary and draw to themselves the goods of this earth as all will and must when grown to a certain stature in spiritual power is a great help for them in time to acquire such power
you have sent and sown in them a seed of thought which will take root and bear fruit at some period of their real or spiritual existence
but if you give grudgingly if you give under any sort of compulsion if you give food shelter clothing money anything only because circumstances compel you so to do or because people might talk unfavorably of you for not giving or because other people are so giving then your gift does relatively little good no matter on whom bestowed be it even mother father brother sister son or daughter
you relieve then only a physical necessity and that only for a time
you may possibly feed a body shelter it clothe it
but you do not and cannot feed properly the spirit that uses that body if the thought going with your gift is not that of the most perfect willingness and hearty pleasure in relieving that body’s necessities
the grudging thought accompanying the gift the thought common to that position when the recipient of the gift no matter how near the relationship is endured rather than enjoyed the thought accompanying any gift to any person or relative that is given principally because custom and public opinion require it or because of the recipient’s importunity is a great damage both to giver and taker
it is the sending to the one who receives a current of thought evil in its character and result
it brings back to the giver from the one who takes a response in thought of like nature and this also is harmful
because if you receive a gift which you have in any way extorted your feeling for the giver is not that of warm glowing gratitude but something quite different
the christ of judea when commending the widow who cast her mite into the treasury did so in our estimation and as seen in this light not merely because she gave in proportion to her material means but because he saw that her thought of desire to help in whatever way help was needed going with that mite was far more heartfelt and genuine than that of richer people who cast in larger sums but cast in also with them a lower character of thought and motive
he saw also that the woman’s thought was actually doing far more to help than that of the others for it was purer less mixed with lower motive and therefore far the stronger
is it not my duty some may ask to feed clothe shelter and support a very near relative or parent if helpless in their old age
the term doing from a sense of duty does not always imply that the thing done be it the person helped or the patient nursed through sickness is done from the impulse of love for that person or love for the doing
it is sometimes done mechanically or with dislike for the doing
it is sometimes a forced and painful performance
for such reason little good is done for if physical necessities are temporarily relieved spiritual necessities are not and unless the spiritual portion of our natures is fed there can be no permanent relief or good done the physical
parents who in old age are supported by their children merely from a sense of duty have sometimes their spirits wounded and starved – wounded because they feel they are endured encumbrances – starved because no real love goes with the gift or service done by these children
children who come into the world unwelcomed by the parent and are brought up only because custom conventionality and public opinion demand their support from that parent are most unfortunate and suffer from the blight and starvation thereby caused their spirits
genuine heartfelt love is literally life giving and if received by the child is for it a source of cheer health strength and activity
there is a certain trained conscience whose basis of education is fear of public or private opinion
this sometimes really impels acts which are said to be done from a sense of duty
if public opinion should suddenly change and cast no censure at all on the person who refused to support very near relatives in want or old age a proportion of such relatives would probably go to the poor house and the son or daughter who sent them there would be acting out their real natures and not feigning a sentiment they did not possess
mothers sometimes say I don’t care what becomes of me so that my children are well brought up and educated
a mother should care a great deal for her own cultivation
if her cultivation and growth in wisdom are checked that of her children will be checked
it will be checked if she sinks herself in her endeavor to favor her children
a genuine mother will continually compel the admiration and respect as well as love of her children
such admiration and respect can be compelled only by a woman who knows the world has standing and position in it and is ever pushing forward to more commanding place and position
such admiration and respect from son or daughter cannot be compelled by the mother who retires to a household corner becomes a cross between upper nurse and governess neglects her dress and personal appearance and teaches her children that she is at their disposal and use in all family emergencies real or fancied
for this very reason are many mothers ignored snubbed and ridiculed by their grown up children
if mothers so sink themselves as they falsely imagine to benefit their children they pay in cases a terrible penalty
if you allow your will constantly to be overborne by another
if you give up your own preferences and inclinations and become only another’s echo
if you live just as others desire you will lose more and more for this existence the power of self assertion
you will absorb so much of the other mind and thought about you as to become a part of that mind and so act in accordance even with its silent will and unspoken desire
you will fossilize and sink into a hopeless servitude
you will lose more and more of both physical and mental power for doing anything
you will become the chimney corner encumbrance the senile parent the helpless old man or woman endured rather than loved
this in many instances has been the effect of the grown up children’s minds upon a parent
it is the silent force of those minds continually working on that of the parent which helps to break the parent down physically and the decay and mental weakness commonly charged to advancing years is due in part to the injurious effect of a mind or group of minds seeking to usurp and overpower another
this evil is done unconsciously
the son wishes to manage the farm
his will may be strong
he gains power step by step
he takes as rights what at first he took only by a father’s permission or as privileges
he goes on step by step having his way in all things great and small perhaps being aided by others of the children using their silent force in the same direction
and this may be a combined force almost impossible for one person to withstand if continually exposed to it
it is a steady incessant pressure all in one direction
it works night and day
it works all the more efficaciously because the parent so exposed to it is utterly ignorant of such a force and its operation upon him
he finds himself growing weak
he becomes inert
he lacks his old vigor and thinks it is through the approach of old age
I knew a man over seventy years of age and as sound active and vigorous in mind and body as one of forty
he had organized and built up a large business
his several children at last took it into their heads that it was time father retired from business
henceforth the thought spoken and unspoken bearing month in and month out on father from the children was this desire and demand that he should retire from business
confiding his situation to a friend he said why should I retire from business
I live in it I like it and so far as I can see am able to conduct it properly
but the persistent demand and force brought to bear on him from these foes of his own blood and household were too great to withstand
he did retire
the sons and daughters were satisfied
the father soon commenced to decline in health
he lived about two years afterwards and one of his last remarks was my children have killed me
ought I not to love my children above all others asks one
the term ought has no application to the nature of love
love goes where it will and to whom it will and where it is attracted
you cannot force yourself to love anything or anybody
there have been parents who had no real love for their children and children who had no real love for their parents
neither party can be blamed for this
they were lacking in the capacity for loving
they were born so lacking
they are no more to be censured for such deficiency than you would censure a person for being born blind or cripple
some parents fancy they love their children yet do not
a father who loses his temper and beats his son does not really love that son
it would be better to say that he loved to beat him or tyrannize over him
government in the family is necessary
bur no sound loving government is administered on a basis of anger and irascibility
parents sometimes interfere and seriously affect the future of a child by opposing its desires in the choice of a profession
the parent may be prejudiced against certain walks in life
the child may wish to follow one of these walks
it meets a bitter uncompromising opposition on the parent’s part
there is no reasoning discussion or counseling in the matter
nothing but a stern positive no
such sentiment and act are not impelled by love for the child on the parent’s part
they are impelled by the parent’s love for his or her own opinion and a love of tyranny
parents sometimes forget that after the child emerges from the utter physical and mental helplessness of infancy it is becoming more and more an individual
as an individual it may show decided tastes preferences and inclinations in some direction
no parent and no person can break or alter these tastes and preferences
no one can make that child’s mind over into something else
for the child’s mind as we call it is really a mind or spirit which has lived other physical lives from infancy to maturity if not to old age and as it comes into possession of its new body and acquires a relative control over that body it will begin to act out the man or woman as it was in its former life and that may be a man or woman very closely related to the parent or hardly related at all
but in any event the parent is dealing with an individual who is growing more and more into tastes preferences and traits of character which belong to and are a part of it these must have expression
they will have expression in mind or spirit whether allowed to physically or not
if the boy is ever longing to go to sea and the parent forbids the boy is on the sea in mind
and if so in mind it is far better that his body should follow for there is only damage when mind and body are not working in correspondence together
if the mother refuse to allow the boy to go to sea because she fears its dangers for him still she is loving her own fears and her own way too more than she does her son
the parent sometimes usurps a complete tyranny not only over the child’s body but over its mind
the child’s tastes inclination tendencies and preferences are held as of no importance whatever
if the boy wants to be a sailor and the parent wants him something else
that something else the parent may insist that he shall be but does he succeed
let the host of mediocrity in all callings in the land answer
and mediocrity means the mechanical following of any pursuit in which there it no live interest
more than this
where a body is compelled to do one thing or live in a certain way and the mind longs to live in another there is a force set in motion which in many cases tears mind and body apart
and parents sometimes grieve over the loss of a child when they are responsible for the death of its body from this cause
how long then should parental control continue over the child
or rather over a spirit for which you have been an agency for furnishing with a new body
is it unreasonable to say that such control should not continue after such body emerging from the helplessness of infancy shall have acquired such control of its organization as shall enable it to meet all physical demands and necessities
to go beyond this and give food clothes shelter maintenance to a person is doing him or her a great injustice and even cruelty
in so doing you do not grant exercise to those faculties which must be used in coping successfully with the world
you make the children the less fitted to be self sustaining and earn their own living
you teach them to lie in a soft luxurious bed when they should be out in the world exercising and making more strong and dexterous their powers both of mind and body
parents sometimes make themselves unjustly responsible and inflict needless mental suffering on themselves for the errors and tendencies of their children
a son or daughter takes a wrong course or rather let us put it a course where the evil is more prominent or more opposed to conventional ideas of propriety than other habits more tolerated and deemed reputable but which may be the subtle and for the most part unknown sources of as great ills as those condemned by society
a son takes to drink or reckless associates and commits some crime
the parent condemns herself for not having looked more carefully after her boy
she may accuse herself as having been through her neglect the prime agency for her son’s misdeeds
madame you blame yourself far too much
you did not make that son or daughter’s character
it was made long before that spirit had the use of its last new body
what traits what imperfections were very prominent in its last existence will appear in its next
if that was a thieving spirit before it will probably show thieving tendencies now
if it was gross animal and gluttonous then similar tendencies will show themselves now
you if grown to a more refined plane of thought may do much to modify and lessen these tendencies
but all that you will do in this respect will be done through the silent force and action of your superior thought on your child’s mind
it will not be done through a great deal of verbal counsel or physical punishment or discipline
whatever a mind is on entering on a new physical experience whatever imperfection belongs to it must appear and be acted out and beget pain and punishment of some kind until that spirit sees clearly for itself how through its errors it brings these punishments on itself
these lessons can only be learned when that person has full freedom so far as parental control goes to live as it pleases
you may for a time control such a life and make it externally live as you please
but such external life is only a veneer if the mind be full of lower tastes and inclinations
the sooner these are lived out the sooner will that person learn the real law which inflicts pains and penalties for breaking its unchangeable rules and the sooner will it know the happiness which comes of living in accordance with its rules
that every spirit must do for him or herself
a parent may mould a false character for a child
it may teach indirectly through the effect of its own mental condition operating on the child how to feign what the world calls goodness how it may seem as regards outward conduct to be what it is not at all in secret tendency and inclination
how in brief to be a hypocrite
no person is really reformed by another in the sense such a term is sometimes used
reform must come from within
it must be self sustaining
it must not depend wholly on another’s presence or influence
if it does it is only a temporary reform
it will fail when the influence of the person on whom it depends is removed
we hear sometimes the assertion such or such a person’s wife has been the making of him meaning the husband
by the way why do we never hear of the man’s being the making of his wife
a man may be prevented from intemperance or he may continually be braced up to meet the world through his wife’s influence and mental power
but if in such reform he relies entirely upon her
if he cannot sustain himself without her continual presence and prompting his is no lasting reformation and he is also a very heavy and damaging load for her to carry
it is a one sided piece of business when one person must supply all the sustaining force for two and if this is persisted in the wife or whoever so supplies it will at last sink under such burden and there will be two wrecked lives instead of one
no person can make another in the highest sense
but one person having the superior mind can if in a very close and long continued association with one weaker give temporarily to the weaker their very life and force if their desire it very strong to help the weaker
if it be the husband who so receives of the wife and is so dependent on the wife then he does not represent any character of his own
he represents and is clothed temporarily with his wife’s character or as much of it as he can appropriate
if she dies or is removed from him then he relapses and sinks into his real self unless he is resolved to be self sustaining and evolve force out of himself instead of using another’s
if she continues to supply him she is only sustaining his temporary character which cannot last when its source of supply is removed and in such continuance she will certainly in time exhaust herself
parents often unconsciously teach their children to lie down upon them to depend upon them too long for moral support
the result of this error is that then the parent’s life is dragged out through carrying so heavy a load the child ceases to have any genuine love for its parent
you may pity what is decrepit weak and shattered
love it you cannot
love is based on admiration and admiration is not compelled by decay
the tendency called instinct which impels the mother bird to turn its young out of the nest so soon as they have sufficient strength to fly and the animal in weaning its young to turn them adrift and leave them to shift for themselves is founded on the natural and divine laws
we may say it is the custom of the brutes and is therefore brutal
but would it be a kindness for the bird to encourage the young to stay in the nest where it could not gain strength and when a few weeks will bring the storms and severity of winter which the parent bird itself cannot withstand
again the parent be it bird animal or human mother needs after these periods of bringing their young into the world and rearing them a season of entire rest and recuperation and the duration of such resting season should be proportionate to the complexity of the organization and the force expended by such organization
during such periods the parent should be freed from any and all demands from the child
birds and animals in their natural or wild life take such periods of rest
but thousands of human mothers are never free from the demands of their children until worn out they drop into their graves
they should be as free so far as their children a concerned as they were in girlhood and before they became mothers
motherhood is a most necessary and an indispensable phase of existence for ripening and developing qualities
but no one experience should be followed and dwelt in forever
life in its more perfected state will be full of alterations
not a rut into which if you are once set you must continually travel
if human children remain with the mother years after attaining what may be termed a responsible age
if they always look to her for aid advice sympathy and assistance
if the mother allows herself to become the family leaning post she may also be repeating the one sided business of supplying too much force to others and getting none back
she may be practicing a false and injurious species of motherhood because it is exacted begged or dragged from her
she may be robbing herself of the new life which awaits her when the brood is reared and their wings are self sustaining
she is helping the children to make her a feeble witless old woman
perhaps one remarks
if your suggestion was literally followed the streets would be full of children turned by parents out of their homes and unable to provide for themselves
so they would
I argue here no literal following of the example set by bird and beast
it would be a great injustice
no custom when followed for ages even if based in error can be suddenly changed without disturbance injustice and wrong
yet it is worth our while to study this principle that we find in nature from the tree that casts adrift the ripe acorn to the bird or animal that casts adrift the relatively ripened young
neither acorn bird nor animal when cast off or weaned ever returns to the parent for self sustaining power
such power in these cases is only given by the parent until the new organization is strong enough to absorb and appropriate of the elements about it absorb of earth and sunshine or flesh or grain the nourishment necessary to its support
are not our streets today full of grown up children quite unable to provide for themselves
do not thousands leave parental homes with no self sustaining power who are all through life unable to feed clothe and shelter themselves save by long hours of drudging labor at the lowest wages
does not this life of drudgery exhaust and cut them off prematurely
are there not thousands of daughters all over the land who will become old maids and whose parents will not permit them were they so disposed to go out in the world and take their chances
these are the birds cuddled in the nest until their wings denied exercise lose at last all power or prompting for flight and whose mouths though they become grown up birds are trained only to open and receive the morsels dropped in them
thought currents
we need to be careful of what we think and talk
because thought runs in currents as real as those of air and water
of what we think and talk we attract to us a like current of thought
this acts on mind or body for good or ill
if thought was visible to the physical eye we should see its currents flowing to and from people
we should see that persons similar in temperament character and motive are in the same literal current of thought
we should see that the person in a despondent and angry mood was in the same current with others despondent or angry and that each one in such moods serves as an additional battery or generator of such thought and is strengthening that particular current
we should see these forces working in similar manner and connecting the hopeful courageous and cheerful with all others hopeful courageous and cheerful
when you are in low spirits or blue you have acting on you the thought current coming from all others in low spirits
you are in oneness with the despondent order of thought
the mind is then sick
it can be cured but a permanent cure cannot always come immediately when one has long been in the habit of opening the mind to this current of thought
in attracting to us the current of any kind of evil we become for a time one with evil
in the thought current of the supreme power for good we may become more and more as one with that power or in biblical phrase one with god
that is the desirable thought current for us to attract
if a group of people talk of any form of disease or suffering of death bed scenes and dying agonies if they cultivate this morbid taste for the unhealthy and ghastly and it forms their staple topics of conversation they bring in themselves a like current of thought full of images of sickness suffering and things revolting to a healthy mind
this current will act on them and eventually bring them disease and suffering in some form
if we are talking much of sick people or are much among them and thinking of them be our motive what it may we shall draw on ourselves a current of sickly thought and its ill results will in time materialize itself in out bodies
we have far more to do to save ourselves than is now realized
when men talk business together they attract a business current of idea and suggestion
the better they agree the more of this thought current do they attract and the more do they receive of idea and suggestion for improving and extending their business
in this way does the conference or discussion among the leading members of the company or corporation create the force that carries their business ahead
travel in first class style put up at first class hotels and dress in apparel as costly as your purse can buy without running into the extreme of foppishness
in these things you find aids to place you in a current of relative power and success
if your purse does not now warrant such expenditure or you think it does not you can commence so living in mind
this will make you take the first steps in this direction
successful people in the domain of finance unconsciously live up to this law
desire for show influences some to this course
but there is another force and factor which so impels them
that is a wisdom of which their material minds are scarcely conscious
it is the wisdom of the spirit telling them to get in the thought current of the successful and by such current be borne to success
it is not a rounded out success but good is far as it goes
if our minds are from what is falsely called economy ever set on the cheap – cheap lodgings cheap food and cheap fares we get in the thought current of the cheap the slavish and the fearful
our views of life and our plans will be influenced and warped by it
it paralyzes that courage and enterprise implied in the old adage nothing ventured nothing gained
absorbed in this current and having it ever acting on you it is felt immediately when you come into the presence of the successful and causes them to avoid you
they feel in you the absence of that element which brings them their relative success
it acts as a barrier preventing the flow to you of their sympathy
sympathy is a most important factor in business
despite opposition and competition a certain thought current of sympathy binds the most successful together
the mania for cheapness lies in the thought current of fear and failure
the thought current of fear and failure and the thought current of dash courage and success will not mingle nor bring together the individuals who are in these respective streams of thought
they antagonize and between the two classes of mind is built a barrier more impenetrable than walls of stone
live altogether in any one idea any one reform and you get into the thought current of all other minds who are carrying that idea to extremes
there is no reform but what can be pushed too far
the harm of such extreme falls on the person who so pushes it
it warps mind judgment and reason all on one side
it makes fanatics bigots cranks and lunatics whether the idea involves an art or study a science a reform or a movement
it connects the extremists of all people in such order and current of mind no matter what their specialties may be
such people often end in becoming furious haters of all who differ with them and in so hating expend their force in tearing themselves to pieces
the safe side lies in calling daily for the thought current of wisdom from the infinite mind
when that wisdom is more invoked our reforms and organizations for the good of the whole will not run into internal wrangles almost as soon as they organize
as now conducted the thought current of hatred of and antagonism to the oppressor and monopolist is admitted at their birth
this very force breeds quarrels and dissensions among the members
it is force used to tear down instead of build up
it is like taking the fire used to generate steam in the boilers and scattering it throughout the building
when people come together and in any way talk out their ill will towards others they are drawing to themselves with ten fold power an injurious thought current
because the more minds united on any purpose the more power do they attract to effect that purpose
the thought current so attracted by those chronic complainers grumblers and scandal mongers will injure their bodies
because whatever thought is most held in mind is most materialized in the body
if we are always thinking and talking of people’s imperfections we are drawing to us ever of that thought current and thereby incorporating into ourselves those very imperfections
we have said in previous books that talk creates force and that the more who talk in sympathy the greater is the volume and power of the thought current generated and attracted for good or ill
a group of gossips who can never put their heads together without raking over the faults of the absent are unconsciously working a law with terrible results to themselves
gossip is fascinating
there is an exhilaration in scandal and the raking over of our friend’s or neighbor’s or enemy’s faults is almost equal to that produced by champagne
but in the end we pay dearly for these pleasures
if but two people were to meet at regular intervals and talk of health strength and vigour of body and mind at the same time opening their minds to receive of the supreme the best idea as to the ways and means for securing these blessings they would attract to them a thought current of such idea
if these two people or more kept up these conversations on these subjects at a regular time and place and found pleasure in such communings and they were not forced or stilted
if they could carry them on without controversy and enter into them without preconceived idea and not allow any shade of tattle or tale bearing or censure of others to drift into their talk they would be astonished at the year’s end at the beneficial results to mind and body
because in so doing and coming together with a silent demand of the supreme to get the best idea they would attract to them a current of life giving force
let two so commence rather than more
for even two persons in the proper agreement and accord to bring the desired results are not easy to find
the desire for such meetings must be spontaneous and any other motive will bar out the highest thought current for good
the old fashioned revival meeting or camp meeting through the combined action and desire of a number of minds brought a thought current causing for the time the ecstasy fervor and enthusiasm which characterized those gatherings the north american indian worked himself into the frenzy of his war dance by a similar law
he brought to him by force of united desire a thought element and current which stimulated and even intoxicated him
his sole desire was to bring on him this mental intoxication
the more minds so working in the same vein the quicker came the desired result
the real orator in his effort draws to him a current of thought which as sent again from him to his audience thrills them
so does the inspired actor or actress
they bring a higher and more powerful element of thought to themselves first and this flowing through them acts on the audience afterwards
if you dwell a great deal on your own faults you will by the same laws attract more and more of their thought current and so increase those faults
it is enough that you recognize in yourself those faults
don’t be always saying of yourself I am weak or cowardly or ill tempered or imprudent draw to yourself rather the thought current of strength courage even temper prudence and all other good qualities
keep the image of these qualities in mind and you make them a part of yourself
you have sometimes been beset absorbed and even annoyed for days in the thought of the suit of clothes you wanted to buy the cut color and fashion of a dress the selection of a bonnet or cravat until you were nothing in thought but clothes hat bonnet dress cravat or some other detail of life
you may not have been able to make up your mind what you should buy and have then possibly been tossed about mentally on the billows of indecision for days
you have then got into the thought current of thousands of other minds continually in this mood of thought
the surest way for a young woman to become ugly is to be discontented peevish cross complaining and envious of others
because in these states of mind she is drawing to her the invisible substance of thought which acts on and injures her body
it ruins the complexion makes lines and creases in the face sharpens the nose and transforms the face of youth into that of the shrew in very quick time
I am not moralizing here or saying
you ought not to do thus and so
it is simply cause and result
put your face in the fire and it is scarred and disfigured because of an element acting on it
put your mind in the fire of ill will envy or jealousy and it is also scarred seamed and disfigured because of an element as real as fire though invisible acting on it
all things that are evil and imperfect such as disagreeable traits of character in others things unpleasant to hear or look upon should be gotten out of our minds as quickly as possible
otherwise if dwelt upon they attract of their thought current
they will then become permanent spiritual fixtures and these will in time materialize themselves into corresponding physical fixtures
if we are always keeping in mind the person doing some wrong thing we are the more apt to do that very thing ourselves
let us endeavor then with the help of the supreme power to get into the thought current of things that are healthy natural strong and beautiful
let us try to avoid thoughts of disease of suffering of deformity of faultiness
a field of waving grain or the rolling surf is better to contemplate than to pore over the horrors of a railway accident
we do not realize how much we are depressed physically and mentally by the incessant feast of horrors prepared for us by the daily press
we invoke in their perusal a thought current filled with things and images of horror and suffering
we bring ourselves in this way in connection and oneness with all other morbid and diseased mind which lives and revels in this current
it leads not to life but to disease and death
neither others nor yourself are one particle aided by your knowing of every fire explosion murder theft or crime which the newspapers chronicle every twenty fours hours
if we read boots written by cynical sarcastic minds who are so warped as to be able to see only the faults of others and at last unable to see good anywhere we bring on ourselves their unhealthy thought current and are one with it
the arrow always tipped with ill nature and sarcasm is deadliest to him who sends it
in other words the man who is ever inviting and cultivating this thought current is inviting the unrest disease and misfortune it will assuredly bring to him and when we get too much into his mind we invite similar results
you may be neat careful and methodical in your habits exact and elaborate in your work yet if you associate closely with those who are careless and slovenly you may find in yourself a tendency to be also careless and slovenly and a difficulty in resuming and carrying out your former neat methodical and orderly methods
because you have not only absorbed of the careless mind or the mind lacking patience to do anything reposefully but the fragment of such mind so absorbed is acting as a magnet in attracting to you its like thought current
when an evil is known it is half cured
bear in mind when you are in any unpleasant frame of mind that a thought current of such disagreeable mood is acting on you
bear in mind that you are then one in a sort of electrical connection with many other sickly and morbid minds all generating and sending unpleasant thought to each other
the next thing to be done is to pray or demand to get out of this current of evil thought
you cannot do this wholly of your own individual effort
you must demand of the supreme power to divert it from you
we can more and more invite the thought current of things that are lively sprightly and amusing
life should be full of playfulness
continued seriousness is but a few degrees removed front gloom and melancholy
thousands live too much in the thought current of seriousness
faces which wear a smiling expression are scarce
some never smile at all
some have forgotten how to smile and it actually hurts them to smile or to see others do so
sickness and disease are nursed into fresher and fresher activity by the serious mood of mind
habit continually strengthens the sad capacity of dwelling on the malady which may be the merest trifle at first
people get so much in this current that woeful diseases are manufactured out of some trifling irritation in some part of the body
many material things are helps to divert a thought current acting disagreeably on you
you may have daily a set of disagreeable symptoms
they may seem to come as adjuncts to the daily routine of life
the breakfast table the furniture the conversation and even the persons immediately about you seem to recall them
travel sometimes banishes them entirely
the sight of different surroundings diverts that particular thought current
material remedies may temporarily effect the same result
so may any sudden change of life or occupation
but all these are secondary aids to the supreme power
the thought current of fear is everywhere
all humanity fears something – disease death loss of fortune loss of friends loss of something
everyone has his or her pet fear
it extends to the most trivial details of life
the streets are full of people who if fearing nothing else fear they won’t catch a train or the next street car
the more sensitive you are to the impress of thought the more liable are you to be affected by this thought current of fear until your spirit by constant demand of the supreme power builds up for itself an armor of thought positive to this current and one which will deny it access
you can commence this building in saying whenever you are affected in the way above mentioned or in any disagreeable fashion I refuse to accept this thought and the mental condition it has brought on me which affects my body
you commence then to turn aside the thought current of evil
everyone has some pet fear some disease they may never have had but always dreaded something they are in special fear of losing
some trifle even but a word or sentence uttered by another brings this pet fear to the mind
instantly through long habit the mind reverts to this fear
instantly it opens to it and the whole thought volume and current rushes to and acts on them
it acts and vibrates on that particular chord of your nature which for years has sounded your pet weakness
then in some way the body is affected disagreeably
there are myriads of different symptoms
the body may become weak and tremulous
there may be loss of appetite tremulousness a dry tongue a bad taste in the mouth weakness in the joints drowsiness difficulty of concentrating the mind on your business and many other disagreeable sensations
such symptoms are often classed as malaria
in a sense the name is a correct one
only in very many of these cases it is a bad atmosphere or current of thought which is acting on our minds instead of the fancied bad material atmosphere
unquestionably an atmosphere full of vegetable or animal decomposition will affect many people
but some live for years in the midst of stagnant pools and swamps who never have malaria
others far removed from such locations on high and dry ground do have it
they hare taken on a thought current of fear
place yourself in a house where there has recently been a panic or scare though you may know nothing of it
you were well and strong the day before
you arise in the morning and soon this whole train of disagreeable sensations affects you because the house or place is saturated with a thought current of fear
put a fear on city town or country of some deadly epidemic or some great calamity and hundreds of the more sensitive who may have no fear of that epidemic or calamity are still affected by it disagreeably
that thought current affects them in their particular a weak spot
a fanatic predicts some great catastrophe
the sensational newspapers take up the topic ventilate it affect to ridicule but still write about it
this sets more minds to thinking and more people to talking
the more talk the more of this injurious force is generated
as a result thousands of people are affected by it unpleasantly some in one way some in another because the whole force of that volume of fear is let loose upon them
some are killed outright
entirely unaware of the cause they open their minds more and more to it dwell on it in secret put out no resisting thought until at last the spirit unable longer to carry such a load snaps the link which connects it with the body
the more impressionable you are to the thought about you the more are you liable to be thus affected
but you can train your mind to shut out this thought
you can gradually train it to bar tightly this door to weakness and keep open only the one to strength
you can do this by cultivating the mood of drawing to yourself and keeping in the mood and current of thought coming of god or the supreme power for good
impressionability or capacity to receive thought is source either of strength or weakness
fine grained sensitive highly developed minds today often carry the weakest bodies because through ignorance they are always inviting some of these currents of evil without any knowledge of their existence or the means of throwing them off
they are ignorantly either courting or exposing themselves to such current
improper individual association is one chief source of such exposure
the finer feminine organization is more sensitive to every shade and ray of thought about it good or bad
men absorbed in their business generate for a time a certain positiveness which throws off the fear current
but this positiveness cannot always last
women from this cause often suffer a thousand fold more in the privacy of their homes than men are aware of
the average man defines it as woman’s way and wonders why she is so full of nervousness vapors notions and ill health
as you place your reliance on the infinite mind to bring you out of all these agencies for ill that mind in some way will bring many material aids to help you out
that mind will suggest medicines and foods and surroundings and changes not only to help you temporarily but permanently so that when you are cured you are cured for all time
a cheerful buoyant hopeful mind and no mind is cheerful hopeful and buoyant without being nearer the infinite than one that is depressed sour and gloomy be that the mind of your doctor or your friend will help you to get out of the injurious thought current
regard such mind as a help from the infinite
but don’t put your whole trust in that individual
put the great trust in the supreme power which has sent to you the individual as a temporary aid or crutch until your spiritual limbs are strong enough to bear you
the more you get into the thought current coming from the infinite mind making yourself more and more a part of that mind exactly as you may become a part of any vein of low morbid unhealthy mind in opening yourself to that current the quicker are you freshened and renewed physically and mentally
you become continually a newer being
changes for the better come quicker and quicker
your power increases to bring results
you lose gradually all fear as it is proven more and more to you that when you are in the thought current of infinite good there is nothing to fear
you realize more and more clearly that there is a great power and force which cares for you
you are wonderstruck at the fact that when your mind is set in the right direction all material things come to you with very little physical or external effort
you wonder then at man’s toiling and striving fagging himself literally to death when through such excess of effort he actually drives from him the rounded out good of health happiness and material prosperity all combined
you will see in this demand for the highest good that you are growing to power greater than you ever dreamed of
it will dawn on you that the real life destined for the awakened few now and the many in the future is a dazzling dream – a permanent realization that it is a happiness to exist – a serenity and contentment without abatement – a transition from pleasure to pleasure and from the great to the greater pleasure
you find as you get more and more into the current of the infinite mind that exhausting toil is not required of you but that when you commit yourself in trust to this current and let it bear you where it will all things needful will come to you
when you are getting into the right thought current you may for a time experience more of uneasiness physical and mental than ever
this is because the new element acting on you makes you more sensitive to the presence of evil
the new is driving the old out
the new thought current searches and detects every little error in your mind before unnoticed and repels it
this causes a struggle and mind and body are for a time unpleasantly affected by it
it is like house – cleaning a process usually involving a good deal of dust and disturbance
the new spirit you call to you is cleaning your spiritual house
there is no limit to the power of the thought current you can attract to you nor limit to the things that can he done through the individual by it
in the future some people will draw so much of the higher quality of thought to them that by it they will accomplish what some would call miracles
in this capacity of the human mind for drawing a thought current ever increasing in fineness of quality and power lies the secret of what has been called magic
one way to cultivate courage
courage and presence of mind mean the same thing
presence of mind implies command of mind
cowardice and lack of mental control mean about the same thing
cowardice is rooted in hurry the habit of hurry or lack of repose
all degrees of success are based on courage – mental or physical
all degrees of failure are based on timidity
you can cultivate courage and increase it at every minute and hour of the day
you can have the satisfaction of knowing that in everything you do you have accomplished two things – namely the doing of the thing itself and by the manner of its doing adding eternally to yourself another atom of the quality of courage
you can do this by the cultivation of deliberation – deliberation of speech of walk of writing of eating – deliberation in everything
there is always a bit of fear where there is a bit of hurry
when you hurry to the train you are in fear that you may be left and with that comes fear of other possibilities consequent on your being left
when you hurry to the party to the meeting of a person by appointment you are in fear of some ill or damage resulting from not being in time
this habit of thought can through an unconscious training grow to such an extent as to pervade a person’s mind at all times and places and bring on a fear of loss of some kind when there is absolutely no loss to be sustained
for instance a person may hurry to catch a street car and act and feel as if a great loss would occur did he not get on that particular car when there may be another close behind or at most two or three minutes’ waiting will bring it
yet the fear of waiting those three minutes grows to a mountain in size and is in that person’s mind a most disagreeable possibility
through mere habit a similar condition of hurry may characterize that person’s walking eating writing – in short everything he does and will render it more and more difficult for such person to act with coolness and deliberation
the quality of mind or emotion underlying all this hurried mental condition and consequent hurried act is fear
fear is but another name for lack of power to control our minds or in other words to control the kind of thought we think or put out
it is this kind of unconscious mental training which is very common that begets a permanent condition of mind more and more liable to large and small panics at the least interruption or trivial disappointment
it makes disappointments when none are necessary
it is the ever  opening wedge letting in more and more the thought current of fear
for if you so cultivate fear of one thing you are cultivating and increasing liability to fear in all things
if you allow yourself to sit in fear for half an hour that the carriage may not call for you in time to get to the boat or train you are much more liable to be seized with a series of little panics at every trivial occurrence or obstacle occurring on that particular journey
in this way does this habit of mind enter into and is cultivated in the doing of so called little things
you are writing or sewing or engaged in the performance of some work which is intensely interesting to you and in which you do not like to be interrupted
if sewing you reach for your scissors which have dropped on the floor
you do this in a momentarily impatient mood and with a spasmodic jerky action
your mind as the phrase runs is on your work
you will not take it off your work while reaching for the scissors
you are trying in mind to go on with your work and reach for the scissors at the same moment
you make the movement of muscles and the action of the body momentarily disagreeable and irksome because you refuse for the second to put into that act the force which it demands
when unconsciously you refuse to do this any acts will become irksome and disagreeable because there is not force enough let on to do the act with ease
it is the endeavor to do it with a weak body
you have the power of throwing your force instantly into any muscle so making the act easy and pleasant
this capacity for turning on force on any part you will increases through cultivating it
and you can do a great deal more and do it better through this cultivation of deliberation for deliberation can be as quick as thought the more the mind is trained in that direction
if you pick up a pin or tie a shoe string in a hurry you do so not only because such act is irksome to you but because you fear it may deprive you momentarily of some bit of pleasure
there you have again opened your mind to the thought current of fear – fear of losing something
the cultivation of courage commences in the cultivation of deliberation in so called little acts like these
deliberation and courage are as closely allied as fear and hurry
if we do not learn to govern our force properly in the doing of the smallest act we shall find such government far less easy in the doing of all acts
if we analyze what we fear we shall find we are in mind trying to deal with too much at once of the thing feared
there is only a relatively small amount to be dealt with now
in any transaction – in the doing of anything there is but one step to be taken at a time
we need to place what force is necessary and no more on that one step
when that is taken we can take the next
the more we train our minds so to concentrate on the one step the more do we increase capacity for sending our force all in one given direction at once
such force extends should be so used in the so called minutest details of everyday life
in this way deliberation and deliberate action become habitual and we are in a sense unconscious of making ourselves deliberate even as after long training in the opposite and wrong direction we are unconscious of putting on the hurried frame of mind
timidity is often the result of looking at too many difficulties or terrors at once
in material reality we have to deal with but one at a time
if we are going to what we fear will be a disagreeable interview with a harsh irascible over bearing person we are apt to go occupying our minds with the whole interview setting ourselves down in the very middle of it and seeing it in mind as necessarily trying or disagreeable
perhaps we were thinking of it this morning while we were dressing
but it was then our proper business to dress
to dress was a necessary step for the interview and to dress well also
possibly it occupied our thoughts while eating
but it was then our proper business to eat and get all the pleasure possible from our food
that was another step
the more reposeful our eating the more vigorous will become our taste and the more strength will our food give our bodies
possibly the fear of this interview was on us as we walked to the place appointed for it
but it was then our proper business to walk and get from our walking all the pleasure he could
that was another step
pleasure is the sure result of placing thought or force on the thing we are doing now and pain of some sort in both present and future is the certain result of sending thought or force away from the act which needs to be done at this moment
when we dress eat walk or do anything with mind placed on something else we are making the present act irksome
we are training to make every act irksome and disagreeable
we are making the thing feared a certainty for what we put out in thought as unpleasant is an actual thing a reality
and the longer we continue to put it out the more force we add to it and the more likely is it then to be realized in the physical world
to bring us what all want and are seeking for namely happiness we need to have perfect control of our mind and thought at all times and places
one most important and necessary means for gaining this lies in this discipline regarding so called little or trivial things just as the discipline and movement of an army commences with the training of the private soldiers’ legs and arms
if you hurry and slur over these so called petty details you are the easier thrown off your guard or confused at unexpected occurrences and in life it is the unexpected that is always happening
we need to keep always our mind present with us
we want it always on the spot ready to use in any direction
our thought is not on the spot when we tie a shoe string and think a mile from that shoe string – when we mend a pencil and dwell in one of tomorrow’s cares
it is then away and if it has for a lifetime been in the habit of so straying from the act in hand to the act afar it becomes more and more difficult to bring it back to use and more difficult to use it promptly when it is brought back
our thought moves from one thing to another with more than electric speed and we can unconsciously train this quickness to be ever darting from one thing to another until it becomes almost impossible to keep it on one thing for ten consecutive seconds
on the contrary through cultivation of repose and deliberation in all things we can train ourselves to mass and fasten our thought on anything as long as we please to throw ourselves into any mood of mind we please and to throw ourselves at will into sleep or a semi conscious dreamy state as restful as sleep
these are very small parts of the possibilities for the human mind
there is no limit to its growth or the increase of its power and no thing coming within the limits of our imagination but can be accomplished by it
the steps to these attainments are very small very simple and relatively easy – so simple and easy that some reject them for that reason
unquestionably these powers and many results coming of their exercise were known ages ago to a relative few
but any power or any condition of mind consequent upon it can be made more clear to an english speaking people through the use of an english word or form of expression than by terms taken from other languages
the north american indian and the oriental had in cases the power of so dismissing all thought and making their minds in a sense a blank as to become not only insensible to fear but this mental condition rendered their bodies almost insensible to physical suffering
it was the power of inducing this mental condition which enabled the indian when taken captive to withstand every device of torture inflicted by his captors and to sing his death song under the infliction of fire and a slow process of bodily mutilation too horrible for description and which very few of our race could endure without passing into the frenzy of agony
the indian is far more reposeful and deliberate than the majority of our race in both mental and physical movement
unconsciously cultivating this repose and living a life less artificial than ours he increased his spiritual power one sure result of which is that command of mind over body which can lessee physical pain and as an ultimate possibility banish it altogether
deliberation of movement or in plainer english movement of muscle so slow that our mind has time to follow it gives one time to think in great and small emergencies
but the lack of such training causes unconscious physical action
so confirmed becomes this habit that the body moves without us aware of it
awkwardness lack of address lack of tact are all due to this lack of command of mind caused by lack of deliberation or in other words a trained incapacity for taking time to think or plan the proper thing to do
the terror stricken person if the ship seems in sudden danger runs up and down the deck to no purpose and this physical action is an exact correspondence of the life long condition of his mind whose thought has been ever so darting from one thing to another just as the whim seized him
the more deliberate person whose mind is trained to take time to think and hold or concentrate its thought holds himself steady and so gives himself time to see what may be the opportunities for escape
and these two persons would pick up a pin in a very different manner and with very different mental action and method
to train then for courage is to train for deliberate movement in all things for that is simply training to mass and hold your force in reserve and let out no more than is needed for the moment
no quality of mind is more needful to success in all undertakings than courage and by courage I mean not only courage to act but courage to think
in everyday business thousands dare not think of taking a step which would involve an outlay of money above the average of their expenditure
they are appalled at mention of so large a sum
they will not out of pure fright entertain the idea long enough to familiarize themselves with it
now if they reversed this mental action and instead of immediately giving way out of life long habit to this fright would take time and allow the thought to rest in their minds instead of driving it out there would in time come to them ideas concerning ways and means for meeting the additional expense and thereby making a larger sum of money in the same time it took to make the small sum
for instance you say to the woman who goes out to wash by the day and has never done anything else
mrs
a
 why don’t you start a laundry
you can make a great deal more money in so doing
I start a laundry! where in the world is the money coming from to start a laundry
is her reply
here the woman instead of entertaining your idea gives way immediately to fright concerning what seems to her the immense sum required and following the same unreasoning headlong panicky style of thought sets up in a moment an opposition to your proposition
she dare think only of working for day’s wages as she is called upon by those who hire her
and thousands for this reason dare not think or find it disagreeable for them to think of getting into some broader more responsible and more profitable sphere of business because they bunch at once all its possible difficulties into a mass and out of mere habit will look only at that awful and imaginary bunch
but mrs
c
 the more deliberate washerwoman hears your proposition and entertains it
in time she says to herself why should I not start a laundry
other people have and have succeeded
she lives in the idea talks to one and another about it and finds out how they started
the longer she keeps in this current of thought the more plainly does she see the ways and means by which other people have set up for themselves
finally the idea so grows upon her that she takes some step toward that end and then another and another and so by degrees drifts into the business
a person is cool and collected in face of any great danger because he has the power of holding his mind to the thing to be done on the instant
cowardice has no such power and can see in mind not only the source of danger but a score of possible results which may or may not happen to him
in battle one man may attend to his duty with a vivid and by no means agreeable condition of mind as he sees men struck and mangled all about him
but the force or thought he can bring to bear on the performance of his duty is greater in amount than that coming of the realization of the slaughter around him and commands and holds his body to his post
the man who runs or would if he had the chance cannot fix his mind on anything but the fearful possibilities of the moment
in the so called trivial act of picking up a pin or threading a needle or opening a door I do not argue that all one’s force or thought should be placed on the act but only enough to perform the act well while the rest is kept in reserve
it is in substance the same as in picking up a weight you would not try to expend the force in lifting one pound that you would in lifting fifty pounds
you do expend a great deal more force in the act of picking up a pin when your mind is preoccupied with something else for you are then trying to do two things or lift two weights at once
you will remember that anything which is done in mind expends quite as much force as if done with the body so that the persons who linger abed in the morning and think with dread of the breakfasts to be cooked or the rooms to be swept so far as expenditure of force is concerned will be doing those acts then and there while lying on their backs
in expending just force enough to perform any act a capacity which will gradually grow upon you as you familiarize yourself with this idea and set your desire or demand upon it you cultivate and increase continually that desirable state of mind which in everyday language is known as having your wits about you
that means in other words always having no matter what you are doing your mental eyes open in every direction and while outwardly you seem all intent and occupied in the one act your mind or spirit like a vigilant sentinel is continually on the look out so as to give you notice in the fractional part of an instant of all that is going on about you and also to direct you how to meet the event whatever it may be
this is not only the characteristic of courage but of tact and address
it was this electric vigilance and mind watchfulness that gave an american officer during the revolution who in the confusion of battle suddenly found himself in front of a british regiment the deliberation to ask what troops are these
the royal scots was the reply
royal scots remain as you are was his answer and he rode off to his own lines
that man had a mind trained to give him time to think
on one occasion mrs
farren the celebrated english actress discovered where her part required her to hem a handkerchief that the property man had forgotten to lay out the handkerchief needle thread etc
without a moment’s hesitation she sat down and imitated so naturally the motion and manner of a lady in sewing that most of her audience never suspected the omission
that act involved self possession coolness deliberation presence of mind courage
do not all these terms imply a similar state of mind
a woman habitually hurried and flurried could not have done this and I believe that when mrs
farren saw proper to pick up a pin she did so in a much more deliberate manner than would the habitually hurried flurried man or woman
cultivate deliberate act and movement in all things and you lay more and more the solid foundation for courage either moral or physical
but deliberate act does not always imply slowness
just as thought moves with electric rapidity so may it move the body when occasion requires but the thought must be clearly planned seen and outlined in mind before it is allowed to act on the body
it is so seen or planned and so acts to use the muscles in the rapid thrust and parry of the skilled fencer and similarly with the professional danseuse in fact in all superior accomplishments be they of painter musician or other artist
these however in many cases are but partial controls of mind
outside of his art the artist may have little mental control or deliberation and as a result be nervous vacillating easily disturbed whimsical and timid
the mind is our garrison to be armed at all points and disciplined to meet any emergency
we deal with the making or self making of whole men and women whose minds are not cultivated all in one direction and neglected everywhere else
it is far better in the end to be growing symmetrically and to be finished so far as we have grown all around than to have our power all concentrated on one talent or capacity and becoming what the world calls a genius
the inside history of genius is often a sad one and shows that it brought little happiness to its possessor
scores and hundreds of the little acts of everyday life such as picking dropped articles from the floor opening and shutting drawers laying or reaching for articles on the toilet table and attending to minor details of dress are done unconsciously in this hurried condition of mind especially when some more important object engages our attention
we snatch we clutch we drive recklessly about in the doing of these things and we weaken our bodies and become tired out and finally panicky and easily frightened through this mental habit for fear and cowardice slip in far more easily when the body is weak
this habit cannot be changed in a day or a year when it has pervaded a lifetime
neither can the ills mental and physical resulting from such habit be cured immediately
there can be only gradual growth away from them
if in reading this you feel convinced that there is something in it and feel also a conviction that some portion of it suits your own case your cure has then commenced
real conviction the conviction that comes from within never leaves one or stops working to get us out of the evil way and put us in the good one
it may seem buried and forgotten for seasons and our erroneous habits may seem growing stronger than ever
that is not so
but as convictions take root we are seeing our errors more and more clearly
we forget that at one time we were blind and did not see them at all
if this book brings to you a conviction of a long established error it is not I individually who bring or convince
it is only that I put out more or less of a truth which takes hold of you and the chord of truth in you senses it
if I apply the torch to the gas jet and light it it does not follow that I make either the fire or the gas
I am only a means or agent for lighting that gas
no man makes or invents a truth
truth is as general and widely spread and belongs to every individual as much as the air we breathe and there is pleasure enough in being its torch bearer without presuming to claim the power of its creator
above all demand more and more courage of the supreme power
look forward
the tendency with many people after they are a little advanced in years is to look backward and with regret
the looking should be the other way – forward
if you want to go backward in every sense mental and physical keep on cultivating the mood of living regretfully in your past life
it is one chief characteristic of the material mind to hold tenaciously to the past
it likes to recall the past and mourn over it
the material mind has a never ending series of solemn amusement in recalling past joys and feeling sad because they are never to come again
but the real self the spirit cares relatively little for its past
it courts change
ii expects to be a different individual in thought a year hence from that it is today
it is willing a thousand years hence to forget who or what it is today for it knows that this intense desire to remember itself for what it has been retards its advance toward greater power and greater pleasure
what care you for what you were a thousand or five thousand years ago
yet then you were something and something far less than what you are today
you are curious you may answer to know what you were
yes but is curiosity worth gratifying if for such gratification you must pay the price of dragging after you a hundred corpses of your dead selves
those selves those existences have done their work for you
in doing that work they brought you possibly more pain than pleasure
do you want ever to bear with you the memory and burden of that pain
especially when such burden brings more pain and deprives you of pleasure
it is like the bird that should insist on carrying with it always the shell from which it was hatched
if you have a sad remembrance fling it off
if you can’t fling it off demand of the supreme power aid to help you do so and such aid will come
if you want to grow old feeble gray and withered go at once and live in your past and regret your youth
go and to revisit places and houses where you lived twenty thirty forty years ago
call back the dead
mourn over them
live in remembrance over the joys you had there and say they are gone and fled and will never come again
in so doing you are fastening dead selves all over you
if we came into another physical life with the memory of the last one we should come into the world physically as miniature decrepit grizzled old men and women
youth physically is fresh and blooming because it packs no past sad material remembrances with it
a girl is beautiful because her spirit has flung off the past and sad remembrance of its previous life and has therefore a chance for a period to assert itself
a woman commences to age then she commences to load up with regrets over a past but twenty years gone
your spirit demands for the body it uses grace agility of movement and personal beauty for it is made in the image of god and the infinite mind and life beauty grace and agility are the characteristics of that mind
in that phase of existence we called childhood and youth the spirit has the chance to assert its desire for beauty and agility because it has not as yet loaded up with false beliefs and regrets
the liveliness sprightliness and untiring playfulness of the boy or girl of ten or twelve is due to the gladness of spirit relieved of the burden that is carried in a past existence
that burden was one of thoughts unprofitable to carry
you would physically have the agility you had at fifteen could you fling off the burden of sad remembrance and belief in error that you have been loading up with these twenty or thirty years past
you can commence the unloading process now by resolving with the aid of the supreme power to fling off the remembrance of everything in the past that has annoyed you everything you regret and everything you have mourned over
god never mourns or regrets
you as a spirit are made in his image
god is eternal life joy and serenity
the more of these characteristics you reflect the nearer are you to the infinite spirit of good
have you buried your dearest on earth
you do them no good by your sad thoughts concerning them
you place bar twixt their spirit and yours in thinking of them as lost
you may in so doing not only increase and encourage in them a sad mental condition but bring their gloomy mental condition on yourself as many do in grieving
the greatest good we can do them is to think of them as alive like ourselves and to fling their graves tombstones coffins shrouds and ghastliness out of our minds
if we cannot do so of ourselves let us demand help of the supreme power to do it
we often make those who have lost their bodies feel dead when we think of them as such
if we do this they will throw back their thoughts of deadness on us
keep out of graveyards
it may seem to some that I am cold and unfeeling to say thus but the truth as it presents itself to me says that the graveyard where your loved ones do not lie is spiritually a most unhealthy place to visit
they are full of the thought of regret death and decay
when you visit them you incorporate such thought into yourself
it is hostile and killing to youth vigor elasticity cheerfulness and life
our graveyards are full of lies
we place a stone over the cast off body of a friend
we place on that stone the word died
that is not true
your friend is not dead
it is only the body he used that lies there
but that grave is planted in your memory and your friend in your mind lies in it
do what we will try to believe what we may of the eternal prolongation of life and the impossibility of anything like death in the universe we cannot help making for ourselves when we think of that grave or revisit it an image of that friend as dead and decaying in his or her coffin
this image we fasten in our minds and in so doing we fasten on ourselves the thought of gloom death and decay
the thoughts of decay and death are things and forces
when we keep them so much in mind we add elements of decay to the body
we need as much as possible to fasten our thought on life and increasing life – life greater in its activity than any we have ever realized
that is not gained by looking backward
look forward
every regret every mournful thought takes so much out of your life
it is force used to pile on more misery
it is force used to strengthen the habit of regretting
it is force used to make the mind color everything with a tinge of sadness and the longer you use force in this way the darker will grow the tinge
also when we are ever going back in memory to the past and living in it in preference to the present we are bringing back on ourselves the old moods of mind and mental conditions belonging to that past
this feeling constantly indulged in will bring on some form of physical ailment
the ailment belongs to a condition of mind which we should be done with forever
if we are looking forward we shall shake it off and be better in health than ever
if the predominant mood of our minds is that of looking backward the ultimate result will be serious to the body
in the world’s business your active enterprising pushing man of affairs spends little time in sad reminiscence
if he did his business would suffer
his thought is forward
that thought is the real force which pushes his business forward
if he spent it in sad memories of the past his business would go backward
he works his success so far as he does really succeed by this spiritual law though he may not know it
you may be saying
I have failed in life and shall always be a failure
that is because you are ever leaking back living in your failure and thereby bringing to you more failure
reverse this attitude of mind
work it the other way and live in future success
why do you say
I am always sick
because you are looking back living in your past ailments and thereby bringing more on you
I have heard the expression used
when the earth was young
as if this planet was now in its dotage and going to decay! in the sense of freshness increase of life refinement and purity in every form of life be that of man animal vegetable and farther on this earth never was so young as it is today
youth is life growing and increasing in beauty and power
it is not the cruder commencement of life
the so called barren rock contains elements which will help to form the future tree and flower
is that part of the rock which enters into tree and flower increasing or decreasing in life
it changes only into a higher and more beautiful expression of life
so do we from age to age
the rock crumbles that it may live in this higher form
the old mind must crumble and pass away to give place to the new and make of us the newer spiritual being
as the old mind crumbles so will the old body for the spiritual change must be accompanied by the physical change
but if you live in the understanding and spirit of this law you need not lose a physical body but have one ever changing for the better
as you live in spiritual belief as the old life goes out the new comes in
nothing in nature – nothing in the universe is at a standstill
nothing goes backward
a gigantic incomprehensible force and wisdom moves all things forward toward greater and higher powers and possibilities
you are included in and are a part of this force
there is of you in embryo the power of preventing the physical body your spirit uses from decaying and the power also of using it in ways which even the fiction of today would discard as too wild for the pages of the novel
for your spirit youth and ever growing youth is an eternal
heritage
if your body has aged that is no sign that your spirit has aged
the spirit cannot grow old in the material sense anymore than the sunlight can grow old
if your body has aged it is because that body has become the material likeness and expression of a false self or shell which has formed on your spirit
that false self is made up of thoughts prevalent around from an early physical age and those thoughts are untrue thoughts
a large proportion of that thought is regret
regret is an inverted force – a turning of the mind to look backward when its natural and healthy state is to look forward and live in the joys that are certain to come when we do look forward
in the new life to come to our race when we have learned to be ever looking forward to the greater joys to come and cease to look backward and drag the dead past with us men and women are to have bodies far more beautiful and graceful than those of today
because their bodies will image or reflect their thoughts and their thoughts will ever be fixed on what is beautiful and symmetrical
they will know that what is to come and what is in store for them out of the richness of the infinite mind must exceed anything they have realized in the past
today with the great majority of people their attitude of mind is directly the reverse
owing to the little trust that they have in that power the theologian calls god they are ever in their minds saying
there are no joys to come for us like our past joys
our youth has fled
our future on earth is tame and dull
it is as dust and ashes
the truth that life does not end with the death of the body makes slow progress in fixing itself firmly in our minds
the kind of life a man may be living here at seventy does not end in the grave
it continues straight on
the old man as we call him here wakes up in the other side of life after losing his body an old man still
if he is one of those old men who have outlived their day and generation who live in their physical past and look back on it with regret who have become too old to learn and think they have got through with it all he will be just such an old man in the world of spirit
there is no sudden transformation into youth on the death of a worn out decrepit body
as the tree falls so does it lie for a period even in the hereafter
but in this state he cannot stay forever
he must grow not in age but youth
to do this it is necessary not only that he should leave the old body but the old material mind that made that body
his spirit throws off that mind when he gains a new body or is reincarnated and he throws it off because he loses the recollection of all past sad memories and regrets
the man should in mind be always the boy the woman the girl
you can as man or woman be always boy or girl in spirit without being silly or losing real dignity
you can have all the playfulness of youth with the wisdom of maturity
to have a clear powerful mind you need not be an owl
there may be for a period a certain use for us in going back to our more recent past lives and for a time living in them
sometimes we are pushed back temporarily into some old condition of mind some old experience in order to make us more alive than ever to the rags and tatters of errors in belief still clinging to us
this may come of revisiting places and people from whom we have long been separated
for a time during such visit old associations the moods connected with them and possibly old habits we thought long since cast off resume their sway
we may become for a time absorbed and swallowed up in the old life
we resume temporarily an old mind or mental condition that was formerly our permanent one in that place or association
but after a little the new mind the new self into which we have grown during the long absence antagonizes the old
it feels aversion and disgust for the narrow life the false beliefs and the dull monotonous purposeless lives about it
it the spirit refuses to have anything to do with the old
then comes a conflict between our two minds the old and the new which may result in temporary physical sickness
our old life or self rises as it were out of its grave and tries to fasten itself on the new and even rule the new
the new self rejects the corpse with horror
but through thus seeing the corpse it sees also fragments of the old self which unperceived have all along been adhering to the new
we do not get rid of error in belief all at once and often unconsciously retain shreds of such belief when we imagine ourselves entirely rid of them
these shreds are the remains of old thoughts and former mental conditions
your new mind so awakened arises and pushes off what it finds left on it of the old
this pushing off is accompanied by physical disturbance because your spirit puts all its force in rejecting these fragments of the former self as you might put all your physical strength in pushing off a snake
our old errors in belief must be so pushed off before the new thoughts which come in as the old go out can have full sway
if your spirit was contentedly and blindly carrying any scorpion of false belief you would tumble into the pit eventually as so many are now doing
when you live several years in any certain house or town or locality you make a spiritual self belonging to that locality
every house tree road or other object you have long been in the habit of seeing there has a part of that self in thought attached to it
every person who knows you there has in his or her mind the self you make there and puts that self out then they meet you or talk of you
if you had years before in that place the reputation of being weak or vacillating or impractical or intemperate and you returned to the people who knew you as such although you may have changed for the better you are very liable in their thought and recollection of you to have this old self pushed back on you and as a result you may for a period feel much like your former self
you return to such place after a long absence
you have during that absence changed radically in belief
you bring with you a different mind
you are in reality a different person
but the old you the old self of former years will rise from every familiar object to meet you
it will come out of houses formerly inhabited by your friends though now tenanted by strangers
you will find it in the village church the old schoolhouse the very rails and fence posts familiar to you long years before
more than all it will come out of the recollection of people who only knew you for what you were say twenty years before
every such person strengthens with you this image of your former self
you talk with them on the plane of that previous life or self
for the time being you ignore yourself as it now thinks and believes
you put aside your newer self not wishing to obtrude on your friends opinions which to them may be unpleasant or seem wild and visionary
you meet perhaps twenty five or thirty people who know you only as your former self and with all these you act out the old self and repress the new this for a time makes the old dead self very strong but you cannot keep this up
you cannot warm the old corpse of yourself into life
if you try to – if you try to be and live your former self you will become depressed mentally and very likely sick physically
you may find yourself going into moods of mind peculiar to your former life which you thought had gone forever
you may find yourself beset with physical ailment also peculiar to that period from which you had not suffered for years
such ailments are not real
they are but the thoughts and wrong beliefs which your old you is trying to fasten on you
I visited recently a place from which I had been absent twenty five years
I had spent there a portion of my physical youth and had lived there with a mind or belief very different from that which I entertain now
I returned to find the place dead in more senses than one
the majority of my old acquaintances had passed away
their remains lay in the graveyards
but I realized this deadness still more among my contemporaries who were said to be living
they had lost the spur and activity of their youthful ambition
they had resigned themselves to growing old
they lived mostly in the past talked of the past good old times and compared the present and future unfavorably with the past
they were in mind about where I left them twenty five years before and about where I was in mind when I did leave them
drawn temporarily into their current of thought ‘‘for old acquaintance sake I talked with them of the past and for some days lived in it
at every turn I met something animate or inanimate to bring back my past life to me
then I went to the graveyards and in thought renewed acquaintance with those whose remains lay there
so I lived for days unconscious that in these moods of sad reminiscence I was drawing to me elements of decay sadness
first becoming very much depressed I was next taken strangely sick and became so weak I could hardly stand
I was continually in a nervous tremor and full of vague fears
why was this
because in going back into my past life I had drawn on me my old mental conditions – my old mind – my own self of that period
but since that time I had grown a new mind – a new self which thought and believed very differently from the old
the new self into whom I had grown since leaving that locality would not accept the old
it shook it off
it was the shaking off process that caused me the physical disturbance
there was a conflict between these two forces one trying to get in the other to keep it out
my body was the battle ground between the two
no battle ground is a serene place to live on when the battle is going on
it was necessary in this case that I should look backward and live backward for a season to show me more clearly the evil of doing so
for no lesson can be really learned without an experience
it was not merely the evil of living backward in that particular locality that I came to see clearly
I saw also for the first time where I had unconsciously been living in the past and living backward in numberless ways and thereby unconsciously using up force which would have pushed me forward in every sense
I understood also after passing through this process why weeks before visiting that place I had felt depressed and experienced also a return of certain moods of mind I had not felt for years
it was because my spirit was already in that place and working through this change
the culminating point was reached when my material self touched that locality
all changes are wrought out in spirit often before our material senses are in the least aware of them
let no one imagine that because I write of these spiritual laws that I am able to live fully in accordance with them
I am not above error or mistake
I tumble into pits occasionally get off the main track – and get on again
power comes of looking forward with hope of expecting and demanding the better things to come
that is the law of the infinite mind and when we follow it we live in that mind
nature buries her dead as quickly as possible and gets them out of sight
it is better however to say that nature changes what it has no further use for into other terms of life
the live tree produces the new leaf with each return of spring
it will have nothing to do with its dead ones
it treasures up no withered rose leaves to bring back sad remembrance
when the tree itself ceases to produce leaf and blossom it is changed into another form and enters into other forms of vegetation
I do not mean to imply that we should try to banish all past remembrance
banish only the sad part
live as much as you please in whatever of your past that has given you healthy enjoyment
there are remembrances of woodland scenes of fields of waving rain of blue skies and white capped curling billows and many another of nature’s expressions as connected with your individual life that can be recalled with pleasure and profit
these are not of the decaying past
these are full of life freshness and beauty and are of today
but if with these any shade of sadness steals in reject it instantly
refuse to accept it
it is not a part of the cheerful life giving remembrance
it is the cloud which if you give it the least chance will overshadow the whole and turn it all to gloom
the science of happiness lies in controlling our thought and getting thought from sources of healthy life
when your mind is diverted from possibly the long habit of thinking and living in the gloomy side of things and admitting gloomy thought you will find to your surprise that the very place the sight of which gave you pain will give you pleasure because you have banished a certain unhealthy mental condition into which you before allowed yourself to drift
you can then revisit the localities connected with your past remember and live only in the bright and lively portion of that past and reject all thought about sad changes and those who have passed away never to return etc
I have proven this to myself
is there any use or sense in admitting things to have access to you which only pain and injure you
does god commend any self destroying suicidal act
grief does nothing but destroy the body
god in the trees or the infinite mind in nature
you are fortunate if you love trees and especially the wild ones growing where the great creative force placed them and independent of man’s care
for all things we call wild or natural are nearer the infinite mind than those which have been enslaved artificialised and hampered by man
being nearer the infinite they have in them the more perfect infinite force and thought that is why when you are in the midst of what is wild and natural – in the forest or mountains where every trace of man’s works is left behind you feel an indescribable exhilaration and freedom that you do not realize elsewhere
you breathe an element ever being thrown off by the trees the rocks the birds and animals and by every expression of the infinite mind about you
it is healthfully exhilarating
it is something more than air
it is the infinite force and mind as expressed by all these natural things which is acting on you
you cannot get this force in the town nor even in the carefully cultivated garden
for there the plants and trees have too much of man’s lesser mind in them – the mind which believes that it can improve the universe
man is inclined to think that the infinite made this world in the rough and then left it altogether for him to improve
are we really doing this in destroying the native forests as well as the birds and animals which once dwelt in them
are our rivers many of them laden with the filth of sewage and factory and our ever expanding cities and towns covering miles with piles of brick and mortar their inhabitants crammed into the smallest living quarters honeycombed with sewers below and resounding with rattle and danger above
are these really improvements on the divine and natural order of things
you are fortunate when you grow to a live tender earnest love for the wild trees animals and birds and recognize then all as coming from and built of the same mind and spirit as your own and able also to give you something very valuable in return for the love you give them
the wild tree is not irresponsive or regardless of a love like that
such love is not a myth or mere sentiment
it is a literal element and force going from you to the tree
it is felt by the spirit of the tree
you represent a part and belonging of the infinite mind
the tree represents another part and belonging of the infinite mind
it has its share of life thought and intelligence
you have a far greater share which is to be greater still – and then still greater
love is an element which though physically unseen is as real as air or water
it is an acting living moving force and in that far greater world of life all around us of which physical sense is unaware it moves in waves and currents like those of the ocean
there is a sense in the tree which feels your love and responds to it
it does not respond or show its pleasure in our way or in any way we can now understand
its way of so doing is the way or the infinite mind of which it is a part
the ways of god are unsearchable and past finding out
they are not for us to fathom
they are for us only to find out and live out in so far as they make us happier
there is for all in time a serenity and peace of mind which passeth all understanding
but this peace cannot be put through a chemical analysis or the operation of the dissecting room
as the great spirit has made all things is not that all pervading mind and wisdom in all things
if then we love the trees the rocks and all things as the infinite made them shall they not in response to our love give us each of their peculiar thought and wisdom
shall we not draw nearer to god through a love for these expressions of god in the rocks and trees birds and animals
do we expect to find god realize him more every day appreciate the mighty and immeasurable mind more every day and get more and more of his power in us every day only by dwelling on the word of three letters g o d
you laugh perhaps at the idea of a tree having a mind – a tree that thinks
but the tree has an organization like your own in many respects
it has for blood its sap
it has a circulation
it has for skin its bark
it has for lungs its leaves
it must have its food
it draws nourishment from soil air and sun
it adapts itself to circumstances
the oak growing in exposed situations roots itself more firmly in the soil to withstand the tempest
the pines growing thickly together take little root for they depend on numbers to break the wind’s force
the sensitive plant recoils at the approach of man’s hand
many wild plants like indians will not grow or thrive in artificial conditions
yet with all these physical resemblances to your own body you deny the tree or plant such share of mind as the infinite gives it
no not that
the tree is a part of the infinite mind even as you are
it is one of the all pervading mind’s myriads of thoughts
we see only such part or form of that thought as is expressed in trunk root branch and leaf even as with ourselves we see only our physical bodies
we do not see our spiritual part
nor do we see in the tree its spiritual part
the tree is then literally one of god’s thoughts
that thought is worth our study
it contains some wisdom we have not yet got hold of
we want that wisdom
we want to make it a part of ourselves
we want it because real wisdom or truth brings us power
we want power to give us better bodies sounder bodies healthier bodies
we want entire freedom from sickness
we want lighter hearts and happier minds
we want a new life and a new pleasure in living for each day
we want our bodies to grow lighter not heavier with advancing years
we want a religion which will give us certainty instead of hopes and theories
we want a deity it is simply impossible to doubt
we want to feel the infinite mind in every atom of our beings
we want with each day to feel a new pleasure in living and commencing where we left off yesterday to find something new in what we might have thought to be old and worn out yesterday
when we come into the domain of the infinite mind and are ever drawing more of that mind to us and making it a part of us nothing can seem flat stale and unprofitable
we want powers now denied the mortal
we want to be lifted above the cumbrousness of the mortal body – above the pains of the mortal body – above the death of the mortal body
can the trees give us all this
they can help very much so to do when we get into their spirit
when we recognize and realize more and more the reality of that part of the infinite which they express and when we can cease to look on them as inanimate creatures
if you can look on trees as fit only for lumber and firewood you get very little life from them
they feel then toward you as you would feel towards a person who regarded you as a thing without mind or sense and fit only to he sawed into lumber or firewood
when we come really to love god or the infinite spirit of good we shall love every part of god
a tree is a part of god
when we come to send out our love to it it will send its love back and that love that literal mind and element coming from the tree to us will enter our beings add itself to them and give us its knowledge and power
it will tell us that the mind and force it represents of the infinite has far better uses for man than to be turned into fuel or lumber
their love will tell us that the forests piercing the air as they do with their billions of branches twigs and leaves are literal conductors for a literal element which they bring to the earth
this element is life giving to man in proportion to his capacity for receiving it
the nearer we are to a conception of the infinite mind
the clearer is it seen by us that this mind pervades all things
the closer we feel our relationship to the tree bird or animal as a fellow creature the more can we absorb of the vitalizing element given out by all these expressions of mind
the person who looks on trees as fit only for fuel and lumber can get but little of this element which to the finer mind is an elixir of life
the mind which sees in tree bird animal fish or insect only a thing lacking intelligence and fit only to destroy or enslave for amusement repels from all of these a spirit or element which if recognized would be received or absorbed and if absorbed would bring a new life and power to mind and body
we get the element of love only in proportion as we have it in us
we can only draw this element from the supreme power
we draw it in proportion as we admire every expression of the infinite
be that expression tree or shrub or insect or bird or other form of the natural we cannot destroy or mutilate what we realty love and the more of these things we really love the more of their element of love flows to us
that element is for us life as real is the tree itself
the more of that life we are receiving and absorbing the more shall we realize a power in life which can only be expressed as miraculous
destroy the forests and you lessen temporarily the quantity of this element given out by them
replace the wild tree by exotics or cultivated varieties and such element is adulterated and the vigor it can give is lessened
cover the whole earth with cities towns villages and cultivated fields and we interfere with a supply of life giving element which the forests in their natural state only can furnish
keep ourselves dead to the recognition of the tree as a part of the infinite spirit and we are dead and unable to absorb of the infinite spirit working in and through the tree
the trees are always giving out an element of life as necessary to man as the air he breathes
man’s works as soon as finished are giving out dust and decay
in our great cities we take in dust with every breath
nothing in this universe is still or in absolute rest
our miles of stone brick and mortar are ever in movement slowly and imperceptibly grinding to an impalpable dust
cloth leather iron and every material worn and used by man is ever wearing into dust
look at the dust which in a single day accumulates in your room on shelf and table or fine garment even when its windows are not opened
a gigantic ever moving force is at work there taking everything to pieces in it
let a sunbeam enter through a shutter’s crack and see the innumerable motes floating in it
think of the myriads of these too minute to rank even as atoms that you cannot see
all this is second hand element which is breathed and absorbed into both body and spirit
but trees and all natural things send out element full of life
our bodies also are ever throwing off through the skin matter they can no longer use
in the great city thousands on thousands of bodies are throwing out disused element too fine to rank even as dust
it is thrown off by sick bodies and many are sick on their feet
this we breathe
we breathe each other over and over again
this unseen cloud of matter pervading crowded cities is not life sustaining
it has in it a certain life as all things have life but it is not fit for man’s growing life
when we get eternal life health and unalloyed happiness the attitude of our minds will be entirely changed toward tree bird animal and everything in nature
we shall see that when we really love all these expressions of the infinite mind tree plant bird and animal and leave them entirely alone they will send out to us in love their part and quality of the infinite
it will flow to us a new life and the source of a life of far greater power and happiness than the present one
but how shall we live one asks unless we cut down the tree for fuel and lumber slay bird and beast for food
do you think there is no other life or way of life than the one we now live
do you think in the exalted and refined mental condition we call heaven that there will be killing of animals mutilation of trees and destruction of any material expression of the supreme wisdom
do you think we can grow into that higher and happier state of mind without knowledge of the laws by which only it can be attained
as well expect to sail a ship around the world without knowledge of seamanship or navigation
we are not to drift into heaven in the way a cask rolls down hill
we cannot cease immediately from the enslavement or slaughter of tree bird or animal nor from the eating of animal food
so long as the body craves and relishes such food it should have it
when the body is changed by our spirit and belief to finer elements the stomach and palate will reject meat of every description
it will not abide the taste or smell of slaughtered creatures
when the spirit settles these matters it does so definitely and forever
man’s error in the past has often been that of endeavoring to spiritualize or change himself of his own individual will into higher and finer conditions
to this end he has enforced on himself and others fasts and penances and abstinence from pleasures which his nature craved
he has never by such methods saved himself from sickness decay and physical death
he has never by this method regenerated or renewed his body
he has lost his body eventually even as the glutton and drunkard lost theirs
the ascetic has not trusted in the supreme to raise him higher in the scale of being but in himself and his own endeavor
this is one of the greatest sins because it cuts such a person off temporarily from the supreme and the life the supreme will send when trusted
there is no way out of any sin any excess any injurious habit but through an entire dependence on the supreme power to take away the gnawing the craving the desire peculiar to that habit
otherwise the man may seem reformed outwardly
he is never reformed inwardly
repression is not reform
the bigot of every age and creed has been the person thinking he could of himself make himself an angel
such belief makes the man stand still in his tracks
the supreme is always saying come to me demand of me
find me in all created things and then I shall be ever sending you new thoughts new things new ideas new element which shall change your tastes your appetites which shall gradually take away grossness eliminate gradually fierce insatiate lawless desire and hurricane of passion and bring to you pleasures you cannot now realize
we shall see more and more clearly in time that when we get the higher finer and more enduring life to which all must grow we shall have the greatest possible inducement to give the trees plants birds animals and all other expressions of the infinite their lives and their fullest liberty
we shall be compelled to love them
what we really love we cannot abuse kill or enslave
we cage a bird for our own pleasure
we do not cage the bird for its pleasure
that is not the highest love for the bird
the highest love for all things is for us a literal source of life
the more things in the world of nature to which we can give the higher love the more of their natural love and life shall we get in return
so as we grow refine and increase this power of recognizing and loving the bird the animal the insect or in other words the infinite in all things we shall receive a love a renewed life strength vigor cheer and inspiration from not only these but the falling snow flake the driving rain the cloud the sea the mountain
and this will not be a mere sentiment but a great means for recuperating and strengthening the body for this strengthens the spirit with a strength which comes to stay and what strengthens the spirit must strengthen the body
we cannot make of ourselves this capacity for so loving and drawing strength from all things
it is our belonging but must be demanded of the supreme power
it is natural to ask but why did not the supreme power implant at first this higher love in us
why has that power so long permitted man to go on slaughtering and marring nature
why are tempests and earthquakes and wars and so much in the forces of nature and the forces of man allowed to go on and bring so much catastrophe and misery
we do not undertake to answer for the infinite wisdom
it is enough for us to know that there is a road leading away from all we call evil
it is enough for us to know that the time is to come when as new beings with changed minds we shall forget absolutely that such evils ever existed
we shall see in the forces of nature be they fire or tempest or aught else only what is good and what can bring us happiness
we are not always to be of the material which can be injured by fire or tempest
the fiery furnace did not affect the three jewish children who walked through it nor was the tempest of any inconvenience to the christ of judea when he walked on the waters
what history has shown to be possible for some is possible for all
communion with nature is something far above a sentiment
it is a literal joining with the infinite being
the element received in such joining and acting on mind and body is as real as anything we see or feel
the ability so to join ourselves with god through his expressions in the cloud the tree the mountain and sea the bird and animal is not possessed by all in equal degree
some are miserable when alone in the forest plain or mountain
these are literally out of their element or current of thought
they can live with comfort only in the bustle of the town or the chatter of the household
they can find life only in artificial surroundings
their spirits are covered with a parasitical growth of artificiality
this cuts them off from any sense of god’s expressions in the solitude of nature
so cut off they feel lonesome in the woods
nature seems wild savage and gloomy to them
whoever can retire for periods to nature’s solitudes and enjoy that solitude feeling no solitude at all but a joyous sense of exhilaration will return among men with more power and new power
for he or she has literally walked with god or the infinite spirit of good
the seer the prophet the miracle workers of the biblical history so gained their power
the christ of judea retired to the mountains to be reinforced by the infinite
the oriental and the indian through whom superior powers have been expressed loved nature’s solitudes
they could live in them with pleasure
they could muse by rock or rivulet or the ocean for hours almost unconscious of immediate surroundings because their spirits had strayed far from their bodies and were dreamily absorbing new ideas of the infinite
you will rarely find a person who as ruler soldier inventor discoverer poet or writer left his impress on the race but loved communion where god is most readily found
there inspiration is born
the poet cannot sing of the city laid out at right angles with sewer beneath and elevated road above as he can of the rugged mountain wrapped like jura in her misty shroud
we cannot train ourselves to this capacity for enjoyment of the natural things of earth or for drawing strength from them
to assume a virtue when we have it not is to be forced gushy and sentimentally silly
but when we demand persistently of the infinite the new mind which can find and feel god in the forest or on the sea in the storm and tempest and feel not only safety but absorb power and strength when nature’s forces seem in their most angry mood that mind with that capacity will gradually take place of the old one and with the new mind all things will become new
some laws of health and beauty
your thoughts shape your face and give it its peculiar expression
your thoughts determine the attitude carriage and shape of your whole body
the law for beauty and the law for perfect health is the same
both depend entirely on the state of your mind
or in other words on the kind of thoughts you most put out and receive
ugliness of expression comes of unconscious transgressions of a law be the ugliness in the young or the old
any form of decay in a human body any form of weakness anything in the personal appearance of a man or woman which makes them repulsive to you is because their prevailing mood of mind has made them so
nature plants in us what some call instinct what we call the higher reason because it comes of the exercise of a finer set of senses than our outer or physical senses to dislike everything that is repulsive or deformed or that shows signs of decay
that is the inborn tendency in human nature to shun the imperfect and seek and like the relatively perfect
your higher reason is right in disliking wrinkles or decrepitude or any form or sign of the body’s decay for the same reason you are right in disliking a soiled or torn garment
your body is the actual clothing as well as the instrument used by your mind or spirit
it is the same instinct or higher reason making you like a well formed and beautiful body that makes you like a new and tasteful suit of clothes
you and generations before you age after age have been told it was an inevitable necessity that it was the law and in the order of nature for all times and all ages that after a certain period in life your body must wither and become unattractive and that even your minds must fail with increasing years
you have been told that your mind had no power to repair and recuperate your body
to make it over again and make it newer and fresher continually
it is no more in the inevitable order of nature that human bodies should decay as peoples’ bodies have decayed in the past than that man should travel only by stage coach as he did sixty years ago
or that messages could be sent only by letter as they were fifty years ago before the use of the electric telegraph
or that your portraits could be taken only by the painter’s brush as they were half a century ago before the discovery that the sun could imprint an image of yourself an actual part of yourself on a sensitive surface prepared for it
it is the impertinence of a dense ignorance for any of us to say what is in or what is to be in the order of nature
it is a stupid blunder to look back at the little we know of the past and say that it is the unerring index finger telling us what is to be in the future
if this planet has been what geology teaches it has been
a planet fuller of coarser cruder and more violent forces than now
abounding in forms of coarser vegetable animal and even human life and organization than now
of which its present condition is a refinement and improvement as regards vegetable animal and man
is not this the suggestion the hint the proof of a still greater refinement and improvement for the future
a refinement and improvement going on now
does not refinement imply greater powers as the greater power of the crude iron comes out in steel
and are not these greater and as yet almost unrecognized powers to come out of the highest and most complex form of known organization man
and are all of man’s powers yet known
internally secretly among the thinking thousands of this and other lands is this and many other questions now being asked
why must we so wither and decay and lose the best that life is worth living for just as we have gained that experience and wisdom that best fits us to live
the voice of the people is always at first a whispered voice
the prayer or demand or desire of the masses is always at first a secret prayer demand wish or desire which one man at first dare scarcely whisper to his neighbor for fear of ridicule
but it is a law of nature that every demand silent or spoken brings its supply of the thing wished for in proportion to the intensity of the wish and the growing numbers so wishing
who by the action of their minds upon some one subject set in motion that silent force of thought not as yet heeded in the world’s schools of philosophy which brings the needed supply
millions so wished in silence for means to travel more rapidly to send intelligence more rapidly
and this brought steam and the electric telegraph
soon other questions and demands are to be answered questions ever going out in silence from multitudes
and in answering them in at first attempting to carry out and prove the answers and the means shown to accomplish or realize many things deemed impossible or visionary there will be mistake and stupidity and blunder and silliness and breakdowns and failures and consequent ridicule
just as there were ten smashes on railways and ten bursted boilers in the earlier era of the use of steam to one of today
but a truth always goes straight ahead despite mistake and blunder and proves itself at last
there are two kinds of age the age of your body and the age of your mind
your body in a sense is but a growth a construction of today and for the use of today
your mind is another growth or construction millions of years old
it has used many bodies in its growth
it has grown from very small beginnings to its present condition power and capacity in the use of these many bodies
you have in using these bodies been far ruder and coarser than you are now
you have lived as now you could not live at all and in forms of life or expression very different from the form you are now using
and each new body or young body you have worn has been a new suit of clothes for your mind
and what you call death has been and is but the wearing out of this suit through ignorance of the means not so much of keeping it in repair as of building it continually into a newer and newer freshness and vitality
you are not young relatively
your present youth means that your body is young
the older your spirit the better can you preserve the youth vigor and elasticity of your body
because the older your mind the more power has it gathered from its many existences
you can use that power for the preservation of beauty of health of vigor of all that can make you attractive to others
you can also unconsciously use the same power to make you ugly unhealthy weak diseased and unattractive
the more you use this power in either of these directions the more will it make you ugly or beautiful healthy or unhealthy attractive or unattractive
that is as regards unattractiveness for this one existence
ultimately you must if not in this in some other existence be symmetrical
because the evolution of the mind of which the evolution of our bodies from coarser to higher forms is but a crude counterpart is ever toward the higher finer better and happier
that power is your thought
every thought of yours is a thing as real though you cannot see it with the physical or outer eye as a tree a flower a fruit
your thoughts are continually molding your muscles into shapes and manner of movement in accordance with their character
if your thought is always determined and decided your step in walking will be decided
if your thought is permanently decided your whole carriage bearing and address will show that if you say a thing you mean it
if your thoughts are permanently undecided you will have a permanently undecided gesture address carriage or manner of using your body
and this when long continued will make the body grow decidedly misshapen in some way exactly as when you are writing in a mood of hurry your hurried thought makes misshapen letters and sometimes misshapen ideas
while your reposeful mood or thought makes well formed letters and graceful curves as well as well formed and graceful ideas
you are every day thinking yourself into some phase of character and facial expression good or bad
if your thoughts are permanently cheerful your face will look cheerful
if most of the time you are in a complaining peevish quarrelsome mood this kind of thought will put ugly lines on your face
they will poison your blood make you dyspeptic and ruin your complexion
because then you are in your own unseen laboratory of mind generating an unseen end poisonous element your thought
and as you put it out or think it by the inevitable law of nature it attracts to it the same kind of thought element from others
you think or open your mind to the mood of despondency or irritability and you draw more or less of the same thought element from every despondent or irritable man or woman in your town or city
you are then charging your magnet your mind with its electric thought current of destructive tendency and the law and property of thought connects all the other thought currents of despondency or irritability with your mental battery your mind
if we think murder or theft we bring ourselves by this law into spiritual relationship and rapport with every thief or murderer in the world
your mind can make your body sick or well strong or weak according to the thought it puts out and the action upon it of the thought of others
cry fire! in a crowded theatre and scores of persons are made tremulous weak paralyzed by fear
perhaps it was a false alarm
it was only the thought of fire a horror acting on your body that took away its strength
the thought or mood of fear has in cases so acted on the body as to turn the hair white in a few hours
angered peevish worried or irritable thought effects injuriously the digestion
a sudden mental shock may lose one’s whole appetite for a meal or cause the stomach to reject such meal when eaten
the injury so done the body suddenly in a relatively few cases by fear or other evil state of mind works injury more gradually on millions of bodies all over the planet
dyspepsia does not come so much of the food we eat as of the thoughts we think while eating it
we may eat the healthiest bread in the world
and if we eat it in a sour temper we will put sourness in our blood and sourness in our stomachs and sourness on our faces
or if we eat in an anxious frame of mind and are worrying all the time about how much we should eat or should not eat and whether it may not hurt us after all we are consuming anxious worried fretful thought element with our food and it will poison us
if we are cheerful and chatty and lively and jolly while eating we are putting liveliness and cheer into ourselves and making such qualities more and more a part of ourselves
and if our family group eat in silence or come to the table with a sort of forced and resigned air as if saying each one to him or herself well all this must be gone over again
and the head of the family buries himself in his business cares or his newspaper and reads all the murders and suicides and burglaries and scandals for the last twenty four hours
and the queen of the household buries herself in sullen resignation or household cares then there are being literally consumed at that table along with the food the thought element of worry and murder and suicide and the morbid element which loves to dwell on the horrible and ghastly
and as a result dyspepsia in some of its many forms will be manufactured all the way down the line from one end of the table to the other
if the habitual expression of a face be a scowl it is because the thoughts behind that face are mostly scowls
if the corners of a mouth are turned down it is because most of the time the thoughts which govern and shape that mouth are gloomy and despondent
if a face does not invite people and make them desire to get acquainted with its wearer it is because that face is a sign advertising thoughts behind it which the wearer may not dare to speak to others possibly may not dare to whisper to himself
the continual mood of hurry that is of being in mind or spirit in a certain place long before the body is there will cause the shoulders to stoop forward
because in such mood you do literally send your thought your spirit your real though invisible self to the place toward which your power your thought is dragging your body head first and through such life long habit of mind does the body grow as the thought shapes it
a self
contained man is never in a hurry
and a self contained man keeps or contains his thought his spirit his power mostly on the act or use he is making at the present moment with the instrument his spirit uses his body
and the habitually self possessed woman will be graceful in every movement for the reason that her spirit has complete possession and command of its tool the body
and is not a mile or ten miles away from that body in thought and fretting or hurrying or dwelling on something at that distance from her body
when we form a plan for any business any invention any undertaking we are making something of that unseen element our thought as real though unseen as any machine of iron or wood
that plan or thought begins as soon as made to draw to itself in more unseen elements power to carry itself out power to materialize itself in physical or visible substance
when we dread a misfortune or live in fear of any ill or expect ill luck we make also a construction of unseen element thought
which by the same law of attraction draws to it destructive and to you damaging forces or elements
thus the law for success is also the law for misfortune according as it is used
even as the force of a man’s arm can save another from drowning or strike a dagger to his heart
of whatever possible thing we think we are building in unseen substance a construction which will draw to us forces or elements to aid us or hurt us according to the character of thought we think or put out
if you expect to grow old and keep ever in your mind an image or construction of yourself as old and decrepit you will assuredly be so
you are then making yourself so
if you make a plan in thought in unseen element for yourself as helpless and decrepit such plan will draw to you of unseen thought element that which will make you weak helpless and decrepit
if on the contrary you make for yourself a plan for being always healthy active and vigorous and stick to that plan and refuse to grow decrepit and refuse to believe the legions of people who will tell you that you must grow old you will not grow old
it is because you think it must be so as people tell you that makes it so
if you in your mind are ever building an ideal of yourself as strong healthy and vigorous you are building to yourself of invisible element that which is ever drawing to you more of health strength and vigor
you can make of your mind a magnet to attract health or weakness
if you love to think of the strong things in nature of granite mountains and heaving billows and resistless tempests you attract to you their elements of strength
if you build yourself in health and strength today and despond and give up such thinking or building tomorrow you do not destroy what in spirit and of spirit you have built up
that amount of element so added to your spirit can never be lost but you do for the time in so desponding that is thinking weakness stop the building of your health structure
and although your spirit is so much the stronger for that addition of element it may not be strong enough to give quickly to the body what you may have taken from it through such despondent thought
persistency in thinking health in imagining or idealizing yourself as healthy vigorous and symmetrical is the cornerstone of health and beauty
of that which you think most that you will be and that you will have most of
you say no
but your bed ridden patient is not thinking I am strong
he or she is thinking I am so weak
your dyspeptic man or woman is not thinking I will have a strong stomach
they are ever saying I can’t digest anything
and they can’t for that very reason
we are apt to nurse our maladies rather than nurse ourselves
we want our maladies petted and sympathized with more than ourselves
when we have a bad cold our very cough sometimes says to others unconsciously I am this morning an object for your sympathy
I am so afflicted! it is the cold then that is calling out for sympathy
were the body treated rightly your own mind and all the minds about you would say to that weak element in you get out of that body! and the silent force of a few minds so directed would drive that weakness out
it would leave as satan did when the man of nazareth imperiously ordered him
colds and all other forms of disease are only forms of satan and thrive also by nursing
vigor and health are catching also as well as the measles
what would many grown up people give for a limb or two limbs that had in them the spring and elasticity of those owned by a boy twelve years old
for two limbs that could climb trees walk on rail fences and run because they loved to run and couldn’t help running
if such limbs so full of life could be manufactured and sold would there not be a demand for them by those stout ladies and gentlemen who get in and out of their carriages as if their bodies weighed a ton
why is it that humanity resigns itself with scarcely a protest to the growing heaviness sluggishness and stiffness that comes even with middle age
I believe however we compromise with this inertia and call it dignity
of course a man and a father and a citizen and a voter and a pillar of the state – of inertia – shouldn’t run and cut up and kick up like a boy because he can’t
neither should a lady who has grown to the dignity of a waddle run as she did when a girl of twelve because she can’t either
actually we put on our infirmities as we would a mask and hobble around in them saying this is the thing to do because we can’t do anything else
sometimes we are even in a hurry to put them on
like the young gentleman who sticks an eye glass to his eye and thereby the sooner ruins the sight of a sound organ in order to look tony or bookish
there are more and more possibilities in nature in the elements and in man and out of man
and they come as fast as man sees and knows how to use these forces in nature and in himself
possibilities and miracles mean the same thing
the telephone sprung suddenly on our folks of two hundred years ago would have been a miracle and might have consigned the person using it to the prison or the stake
all unusual manifestations of nature’s powers being then attributed to the devil because the people of that period had so much of the devil or cruder element in them as to insist that the universe should not continually show and prove higher and higher expressions of the higher mind for man’s comfort and pleasure
museum and menagerie horrors
a menagerie of beasts and birds means a collection of captured walking and flying creatures taken from their natural modes of life deprived permanently of such modes and suffering more or less in consequence
the bird used to the freedom of forest and air is imprisoned in the most limited quarters
its plumage there is never as fresh and glossy as in its natural state
it does not live as long
the captive life of the many species brought from the tropics is very short especially of the smaller and more delicate species
bears lions tigers deer wolves and all other animals like liberty and freedom of range as well as man
in the menagerie they are deprived of it
the air they breathe is often fetid and impure
to the burrowing animal earth is as much a necessity and comfort as a comfortable bed is to us
the captured burrower is often kept on a hard board floor which in its restless misery to get into its native earth it scratches and wears away in cavities inches in depth
monkeys by the thousand die prematurely of consumption because forced to live in a climate too cold and damp for them and no amount of artificial heat can supply the element to which they have been accustomed in the air of their native tropic groves and jungles
seals are kept in tanks of fresh water when salt water is their natural element
their captive lives are always short
there is no form of organized life but is a part and belonging of the locality and latitude where in its wild state it is born
the polar bear is a natural belonging of the arctic regions
the monkey is a belonging and outgrowth of tropical conditions
when either of these is taken from climes native to them and out of which they do not voluntarily wander pain is inflicted on them
go to the cheap museum now so plentiful and regard the bedraggled plumage and apparent sickly condition of many of the birds natives of distant climes imprisoned there
you see them but for an hour
return in a few months and you will not find them
what has become of them
they have died and their places are supplied by others likewise slowly dying
the procession of captives so to suffer and die prematurely never ceases moving into these places
ships are constantly bringing them hither
an army of men distributed all over the world and ranging through the forests of every clime is constantly engaged in trapping them
for what reasons are all these concentrations of captured misery now to be found in every large town and city of our country
simply to gratify human curiosity
simply that we may stand a few minutes and gaze at them behind their bars
what do we then learn of their real natures and habits in these prisons
what would be learned of your real tastes inclinations and habits were you kept constantly in a cage
is the gratification of this curiosity worth the misery it costs
if a bird wooed by your kindness comes and builds its nest in a tree near your window and there rears its brood is not the sight it affords from day to day worth a hundred times more than that of the same bird deprived of its mate and shut up in a cage
will you not is in its freedom you study its real habits and see its real and natural life feel more and more drawn to it by the tie of a common sympathy as you see evidenced in that life so much that belongs to your own
like you it builds a home
like you it has affection and care for its mate
like you it provides for its family
like you it is alarmed at the approach of danger
like you it nestles in the thought of security
yet so crude and cruel still is the instinct in our race that the ruin of the wild bird’s home or its slaughter or capture is the ruling desire with nineteen boys out of twenty as they roam the woods
and cultured parents will see their children leave the house equipped with the means for this destruction without even the thought of protest
the god in yourself
as a spirit you are a part of god or the infinite force or spirit of good
as such part you are an ever growing power which can never lessen and must always increase even as it has in the past through many ages always increased and built you up as to intelligence to your present mental stature
the power of your mind has been growing to its present quality and clearness through many more physical lives than the one you are now living
through each past life you have unconsciously added to its power
every struggle of the mind
be it struggle against pain struggle against appetite struggle for more skill in the doing of anything struggle for greater advance in any art or calling struggle and dissatisfaction at your failings and defects is an actual pushing of the spirit to greater power and a greater relative completion of yourself and with such completion happiness
for the aim of living is happiness
there is today more of you and more of every desirable mental quality belonging to you than ever before
the very dissatisfaction and discontent you may feel concerning your failings is a proof of this
if your mind was not as clear as it is it could not see those failings
you are not now where you may have been in a mood of self complacency when you thought yourself about right in every respect
only you may now in looking at yourself have swung too far in the opposite direction
and because your eyes have been suddenly opened to certain faults you may think these faults to be constantly increasing
they are not
the god in yourself – the ever growing power in yourself – has made you see an incompleteness in your character
yet that incompleteness was never so near a relative completion as now
of this the greatest proof is that you can now see what in yourself you never saw or felt before
you may have under your house a cavity full of vermin and bad air
you were much worse off before the cavity was found repulsive as it may be to you
and now that it is found you may be sure it will be cleansed
there may be cavities in our mental architecture abounding in evil element and there is no need to be discouraged as the god in our self shows them to us
there is no need of saying I’m such an imperfect creature I’m sure I can never cure all my faults
yes you can
you are curing them now
every protest of your mind against your fault is a push of the spirit forward
only you must not expect to cure them all in an hour a day a week or a year
there will never be a time in your future existence but that you can see where you can improve yourself
if you see possibility of improvement you must of course see the defect to be improved
or in other words you see for yourself a still greater completion a still greater elaboration a finer and finer shading of your character a more and more complicated distribution of the force always coming to you
so you will cease this fretting over your being such an imperfect creature when you find as you will that you are one of the temples of god ever being built by yourself into ever increasing splendor
no talent of yours ever stops growing any more than the tree stops growing in winter
if you are learning to paint or draw or act or speak in public or do anything and cease your practice entirely for a month or a year or two years and then take it up again you will find after a little that an increase of that talent has come
that you have new ideas concerning it and new power for execution
you ask what is the aim of life
in a sense you cannot aim your own life
there is a destiny that aims it a law which governs and carries it
to what
to an ever increasing and illimitable capacity for happiness as your power increases and increase it must
you cannot stop growing despite all appearances to the contrary
the pain you have suffered has been through that same growth of the spirit pressing you harder and harder against what caused you misery so that at last you should take that pain as a proof that you were on some wrong path out of which you must get as soon as possible
and when you cry out hard and are in living earnest to know the right way something will always come to tell you the right way
for it is a law of nature that every earnest call is answered and an earnest demand or prayer for anything always brings the needed supply
what is the aim of life
to get the most happiness out of it
to so learn to live that every coming day will be looked for in the assurance that it will be as full and even fuller of pleasure than the day we now live in
to banish even the recollection that time can hang heavily on our hands
to be thankful that we live
to rise superior to sickness or pain
to command the body through the power of the spirit so that it can feel no pain
to control and command the thought so that it shall ever increase in power to work and act separate apart and afar from our body so that it shall bring us all that we need of house or land or food or clothes and that without robbing or doing injustice to anyone
to gain in power so that the spirit shall ever recuperate reinvigorate and rejuvenate the body so long as we desire to use it so that no part or organ shall weaken wither or decay
to be learning ever new sources of amusement for ourselves and others
to make ourselves so full of happiness and use for others that our presence may ever be welcome to them
to be no one’s enemy and every one’s friend
that is the destiny of life in those domains of existence where people as real as we and much more alive than we have learned and are ever learning how to get the most of heaven out of life
that is the inevitable destiny of every individual spirit
you cannot escape ultimate happiness and permanent happiness as you grow on and on in this and other existences
and all the pains you suffer or have suffered are as prods and pokes to keep you out of wrong paths to make you follow the law
and the more sensitive you grow the more clearly will you see the law which leads away from all pain and ever toward more happiness and to a state of mind where it is such an ecstasy to live that all sense of time is lost as the sense of time is lost with us when we are deeply interested or amused or gaze upon a thrilling play or spectacle so that in the words of the biblical record a day shall be as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day
the nirvana of the hindus suggests all the possibilities of life coming to our planet nirvana implying that calmness serenity and confidence of mind which comes of the absolute certainty that every effort we make every enterprise we undertake must be successful
and that the happiness we realize this month is but the stepping stone to the greater happiness of next
if you fell that the trip of foreign travel you now long for and wish for was as certain to come as now you are certain that the sun rose this morning
if you knew that you would achieve your own peculiar and individual proficiency and triumph in painting or oratory or as an actor or sculptor or in any art as surely as now you know you can walk downstairs you would not of course feel any uneasiness
in all our relatively perfected lives we shall know this because we shall know for an absolute certainty that when we concentrate our mental force or thought on any plan or pursuit or undertaking we are setting at work the attractive force of thought  substance to draw to us the means or agencies or forces or individuals to carry out that plan as certainly as the force of muscle applied to a line draws the ship to its pier
you worry very little now as to your telegram reaching its destination because while you know next to nothing as to what electricity is you do know that when it is applied in a certain way it will carry your message
and you will have the same confidence that when your thought is regulated and directed by a certain method it will do for you what you wish
before men knew how to use electricity there was as much of it as today and with the same power as today
but so far as our convenience was concerned it was quite useless as a message bearer because of a lack of knowledge to direct it
the tremendous power of human thought is with us all today very much in a similar condition
it is wasted because we do not know how to concentrate and direct it
it is worse than wasted because through ignorance and life long habit we work our mental batteries in the wrong direction and send from us bolt after bolt of ill will toward others or enviousness or snarls or sneers or some form of ugliness all this being real element wrongly and ignorantly applied which may strike and hurt others and will certainly hurt us
here is the cornerstone of all successful effort in this existence or any other
never in thought acknowledge an impossibility
never in mind reject what to you may seem the wildest idea with scorn
because in so doing you may not know what you are closing the door against
to say anything is impossible because it seems impossible to you is just so much training in the dangerous habit of calling out impossible! to every new idea
your mind is then a prison full of doors barred to all outside and you the only inmate
all things are possible with god
god works in and through you
to say impossible! as to what you may do or become is a sin
it is denying god’s power to work through you
it is denying the power of the infinite spirit to do through you far more than what you are now capable of conceiving in mind
to say impossible! is to set up your relatively weak limit of comprehension as the standard of the universe
it is as audacious as to attempt the measurement of endless space with a yard stick
when you say impossible! and I can’t you make a present impossibility for yourself
this thought of yours is the greatest hindrance to the possible
it cannot stop it
you will be pushed on hang back as much as you may
there can be no successful resistance to the eternal and constant betterment of all things including yourself
you should say it is possible for me to become anything which I admire
you should say
it is possible for me to become a writer an orator an actor an artist
you have then thrown open the door to your own temple of art within you
so long as you said
impossible! you kept it closed
your I can’t was the iron bolt locking that door against you
your I can is the power shoving back that bolt
christ’s spirit or thought had power to command the elements and quiet the storm
your spirit as a part of the great whole has in the germ and waiting for fruition the same power
christ through power of concentrating the unseen element of his thought could turn that unseen element into the seen and materialize food
loaves and fishes
that is a power inherent in every spirit and every spirit is growing to such power
you see today a healthy baby boy
it cannot lift a pound
but you know there lies in that feeble child the powers and possibilities which twenty years hence may enable it to lift with ease two hundred pounds
so the greater power the coming spiritual power can be foretold for us who are now relatively babes spiritually
the reason for life’s being so unhappy here in this region of being is that as we do not know the law we go against it and get thereby its pains instead of its pleasures
the law cannot be entirely learned by us out of past record or the past experience of anyone no matter to what power they might have attained
such records or lives may be very useful to us as suggesters
but while there are general principles that apply to all there are also individual laws that apply to every separate and individualized person
you cannot follow directly in my track in making yourself happier and better nor can I in yours
because every one of us is made up of a different combination of element as element has entered into and formed our spirits our real selves through the growth and evolution ages
you must study and find out for yourself what your nature requires to bring it permanent happiness
you are a book for yourself
you must open this book page after page and chapter after chapter as they come to you with the experience of each day each month each year and read them
no one else can read them for you as you can for yourself
no one else can think exactly as you think or feel just as you feel or be affected just as you are affected by otter forces or persons about you
and for this reason no other person can judge what you really need to make your life more complete more perfect more happy so well as yourself
you must find out for yourself what association is best for you what food is best for you and what method in any business any art any profession brings you the best results
you can be helped very much by conferring with others who are similarly interested
you can be very much helped by those who may have more knowledge than you of general laws
you can be greatly helped to get force or courage or new ideas to carry out your undertakings by meeting at regular intervals with earnest sincere and honest people who have also some definite purpose to accomplish and talking yourself out to them and they to you
but when you accept any man or any woman as an infallible guide or authority and do exactly as they say you are off the main track
because then you are making the experiments of another person formed of a certain combination of elements or chemicals and the result of that person’s experiments the rule for your own individual combination of element when your combination may be very different and differently acted on by the elements outside of it
you have iron and copper and magnesia and phosphorus and more of other minerals and chemicals and combination and re combination of mineral and chemical in your physical body than earthly science has yet thought of
you have in your spirit or thought the unseen or spiritual correspondences of these minerals still finer and more subtle
and all these are differently combined and in different proportions from any other physical or spiritual body
how then can anyone find out the peculiar action of this your individual combination save yourself
there are certain general laws
but every individual must apply the general law to him or herself
it is a general law that the wind will propel a ship
but every vessel does not use the air in exactly the same fashion
it is a general law that thought is force and can effect and is constantly effecting results to others far from our bodies
and the quality of our thought and its power to affect results depends very much on our associations
but for that reason if yours is the superior thought or power and I see that through its use you are moving ahead in the world I should not choose your character of associates or your manner of life
I can try your methods as experiments
but I must remember they are only experiments
I must avoid that so common error
the error of slavish copy and idolatry of another
the christ of nazareth once bade certain of his followers not to worship him
call me not good said he
there is none good save god alone
christ said I am the way and the life meaning as the text interprets itself to me that as to certain general laws of which he was aware and by which he also as a spirit was governed he knew and could give certain information
but he never did assert that his individual life with all the human infirmity or defect that he had taken upon him was to be strictly copied
he did pray to the infinite spirit of good for more strength and deliverance from the sin of fear when his spirit quailed at the prospect of his crucifixion
and in so doing he conceded that he as a spirit powerful as he was needed help as much as any other spirit
and knowing this he refused to pose himself before his followers as god or the infinite but told them that when they desired to bow before that almighty and never to be comprehended power out of which comes every good at the prayer or demand of human mind to worship god alone
god the eternal and unfathomable moving power of boundless universe
the power that no man has ever seen or ever will see save as he sees its varying expressions in sun star cloud wind bird beast flower animal or in man as the future angel or archangel and ascending still to grades of mind and grades of power higher and higher still
but ever and ever looking to the source whence comes their power and never never worshipping any one form of such expression and by so doing making the creature greater than the creator
that power is today working on and in and through every man woman and child on this planet
or to use the biblical expression it is god working in us and through us
we are all parts of the infinite power a power ever carrying us up to higher finer happier grades of being
every man or woman no matter what may be their manner of life or grade of intellect is a stronger and better man or woman than ever they were before despite all seeming contradiction
the desire in human nature and all forms of nature or of spirit expressed through matter to be more and more refined is up to a certain growth of mind an unconscious desire
the god desire is at work on the lowest drunkard rolling in the gutter
that man’s spirit wants to get out of the gutter
ii is at work on the greatest liar prompting him if ever so feebly that the truth is better
it is at work on people you may call despicable and vile
when christ was asked how often a man should be forgiven any offence he replied in a manner indicating that there should be no limit to the sum of one man or woman’s forgiveness for the defects or immaturity in another
there should be no limit to the kind and helpful thought we think or put out toward another person who falls often who is struggling with some unnatural appetite
it is a great evil often done unconsciously to say or think of an intemperate man ‘‘ oh he’s gone to the dogs
it’s no use doing anything more for him! because when we do this we put hopeless discouraging thought out in the air
it meets that person
he or she will feel it
and it is to them an element retarding their progress out of the slough they are in just as some person’s similar thought has retarded us in our effort to get out of some slough we were in or are in now
slough of indecision
slough of despondency
slough of ill temper
slough of envious hating thought
yet the spirit of man becomes the stronger for all it struggles against
it becomes the stronger for struggling against your censorious uncharitable thought until at last it carries a man or woman to a point where they may in thought say to others I would rather have your approbation than your censure
but I am not dependent on your approbation or censure for my most rigid judge and surest punishment for all the evil I do comes of my own mind the god or goddess in myself from whose judgment from whose displeasure there is no escaping
yet as the spirit grows clearer and clearer in sight so does that judge in ourselves become more and more merciful for its own errors
for it knows that in a sense as we refine from cruder to finer expression there must be just so much evil to be contended against fought against and finally and inevitably overcome
every man and woman is predestined to a certain amount of defect until the spirit overcomes such defect
and overcome it must for it is the nature of spirit to struggle against defect
it is the one thing impossible for man to take this quality out of his own spirit
the quality of ever rising toward more power and happiness
if you make this an excuse to sin or commit excess or lie or steal or murder and say I can’t help it
I’m predestined to it you will be punished all the same not possibly by man’s law but by natural or divine law which has its own punishments for every possible sin
for murder or lust or lying or stealing or evil thinking or gluttony
and these punishments are being constantly inflicted and today thousands on thousands are suffering for the sins they commit in ignorance of the law of life
and the pain of such punishment has grown so great and bears so heavily on so many that there is now a greater desire than ever to know more of these laws
and for that very reason is this desire being met and these questions are being answered
for it is an inevitable law of nature that what the human mind demands that it in time gets
and the greater the number of minds so demanding the sooner is the demand met and the questions answered
steam but a few years ago relatively met the demand of human mind for greater speed in travel
electricity met a demand for greater speed in sending intelligence from man to man
these are but as straws pointing to the discovery and use of greater powers not only in elements outside of man but in the unseen elements which make man and woman
in the elements unseen which make you and me
henceforth our race will commence to be lifted out of evil or cruder forms of expression not by fear of the punishments coming through violation of the law but they will be led to the wiser course through love of the delight which comes of following the law as we discover it for ourselves
you eat moderately because experience has taught that the greater pleasure comes of moderation
you are gentle kind and considerate to your friend not that you have constantly before your mind the fear of losing that friend if you are not kind and considerate but because it pleases you and you love the doing of kind acts
human law and even divine law as interpreted by human understanding have ever been saying in the past you must not do this or that or you’ll feel the rod
god has been pictured as a stern merciless avenging deity
the burden of the preacher’s song has been penalty and punishment! punishment and penalty! humanity is to forget all about penalty and punishment because it is to be won over and tempted to greater goodness to purity and refinement by the ever increasing pleasures brought us as we refine
the warning of penalty was necessary when humanity was cruder
it could only be reached by the rod
the race was blind and as a necessity of its condition it had to be kept somewhere near the right path by a succession of painful prods and pokes with the sharp goad of penalty
but when we begin to see clearer as now the more quickened and sensitive of our race do begin to see we need no rod anymore than you need a man with a club to prevail on you to go to a feast
the healing and renewing force of spring
your body is acted on in its growth and changes by the same laws and elements which govern the growth and enter into all other organized bodies such as trees plants birds and animals
in the early spring of every year there comes and acts on this planet a force from the sun which affects all organized forms of life  trees birds animals and above all man
man’s being the highest most complicated and most powerful mental organism on the planet absorbs the most of this power and will absorb far more in the future and to far greater advantage than at present as he learns to place himself in the best states to receive it
material science calls this force heat’’
but the quality known as heat is only its outward or physical manifestation
the quality known as heat which comes from the sun is not converted into heat until it reaches our planet and acts on the earth elements
there is little or no heat a few miles above the earth’s surface
were this force in the form of heat on leaving the sun or during its passage the air on the mountain tops would be as warm as that of the valleys
as we know on the highest peaks snow and ice are perpetual for the sun force at such elevation is not sufficiently mingled with earth elements to convert it into that degree of heat felt in the valleys and plains
this force causes the increased movement and circulation of sap in the trees which commences as soon as the sun of the new year acts on them
the sap is a new life to the tree from which later comes its buds blossoms and fruitage
the inflowing of this unseen sun force gives the tree power to draw new supplies of nourishing elements through its roots from the earth
it gives it power also to cast off any dead leaves remaining of the last year’s crop which have hung on during the winter as you may see in forests of oak or hickory
this force acts also in the later winter and earlier spring months on animals and birds especially if in their wild or natural state causing them to shed their last year’s coats of fur or feathers
but this casting off of old visible matter is but a relatively small part of the change going on within them
there is also a casting out or shedding of old invisible matter throughout the bird or animal’s entire body
it goes off through the pores or other passages in various forms some visible others invisible and is succeeded by new elements within as the new fur hair or feather is grown without
your body is governed by the same law
during the later winter and earlier spring months you are molting
you are casting off old dead matter and taking in new providing you give this force opportunity to act on you to the best advantage by ceasing to be active either with mind or body when they call for rest as do birds and animals during their molting period or process of casting off the old elements and receiving the new
this element or force received at this time by you and them is invisible to the physical eye as all force is invisible
the new fur the new plumage of the bird the new skin and tissues without and within your body if received the new buds leaves and twigs are all materialized expressions of this force
they are new crystallizations coming of a new solution of invisible chemicals in which bird animal tree and your body are bathed
all of last year’s solution or elements so absorbed have been used up
the tree or other visible organization of bird animal or your body stands in the same relation to this re clothing solution as does the slip of metal in the solution of mineral which attracts out of such solution the crystallizations which form on it
there is no great dividing line betwixt what we call matter and spirit
matter is but a form of spirit or thought seen of the physical eye
matter is force temporarily materialized as in the lump of coal which when set on fire sends off the force bound up in it to move the engine
the lump passes then mostly into element invisible
so all about us we find force ever passing from physical visibility into invisibility and vice versa
millions on millions of tons of invisible matter may be on a clear day suspended over our heads one hour the next to fall in the visible form of rain or snow which a few hours after may be drawn upward again but invisible
the indian called february and march the weak months recognizing as he did being a closer observer of nature than we the tendency to sluggishness and inactivity in animal and man which always prevails when this power is recuperating and renewing any organized body
the most perfect crystallizations out of mineral element come of the solution kept most free from agitation
your body is governed by the same law in this spring renewing and re crystallization of its elements
to receive the fullest benefit of the heating and renewing element of spring you should rest whenever you feel like resting whether it be the middle of the day or the middle of the night
if you keep the body or mind at work against their inclination – if you force your muscles to exertion through mere strength of will   if you work with either mind or body to the verge of utter exhaustion not knowing how depleted you are of strength until your work is over as thousands on thousands do and are compelled to do through our unnatural system of life and the arbitrary demands of business you prevent this healing and recuperative power from acting to its fullest extent on the body
you prevent the new element which is renewing the tree and causing the buds to swell from assimilating with your body
you hold on to worn out element which should be cast off as the oak has cast all its dead leaves before the winter is over
you carry then this dead element a dead weight about with you instead of the new and upward rising life
it is this among other causes which stoops the shoulders bleaches the hair and furrows the face with wrinkles through shrinkage of tissues
the decay of the physical body which we call old age is owing entirely to man’s neither believing nor knowing that he can place himself in the proper conditions to receive a never ceasing supply of force which would re clothe the spirit constantly with new material
mere muscular strength and constant activity of body are not always signs of the most perfect health
in the delirium of fever a relatively weak man may require two or three others to hold him
when this delirium has passed away he is weak as an infant yet often the crisis being passed is pronounced out of danger
in a manner somewhat similar in the walks of business in the keen almost fierce competition of trade thousands of people lead a feverish excited life
they are always on a tension
they demand to be in this state
they cannot work unless strung up to a certain pitch
if at times through nature’s own demand for rest their nerves are relaxed and they feel languid they mistake this friendly signal for some form of disease and treat it accordingly
even in these cases when laid for weeks or months on sick beds and nursed through what is called a dangerous illness and believing it to be one they sometimes come out at last better and stronger than they had been for a long period previous
why
because through this enforced cessation from physical or mental activity nature was working as well as she could under certain unfavorable circumstances rebuilding a worn out body and as a result the man arose with new fresh element in his bones muscles and nerves put there because nature had then his body laid up in quiet so that it could be repaired
if you will but entertain this idea of spring’s renewing force respectfully though you cannot believe it thoroughly at first you will receive much help by such respectful entertainment
for if you do not kick a live truth out of your mind when it first presents itself it will take root and live there and prove itself by doing you good
men through incessant physical toil wear out far sooner than is generally realized
the hardy sailor’s hardiness often lasts but a few years
he is often an old man at forty five
the toiling farmer who works the year round from early dawn till dark and thinks work to be the greatest virtue in the world is often a mass of bony knobs and rheumatism at fifty
the average duration of lives of hard labor is much less than those given to occupations requiring less physical lugging straining and fagging hour after hour when the body is really exhausted
in the mines of california where I swung a pick for years and worked with gangs of men lifting wheeling and shoveling I noted that the last three hours of a day’s work of ten and sometimes twelve hours’ length was done by the men strong as they might be with far less spirit than the earlier day’s labor in fact it was often a mere pretence of work unless the watchful eye of the boss was constantly on his men
why
because physically they were no longer fit to work
it was only will that was urging muscle to exertion
and of the stout hardy miners aged twenty five or thereabout who were so working in and who persisted in such drudgery a large majority are dead and of those who are alive today four fifths are broken down men
in the kingdom of nature we find periods of rest constantly alternating with periods of activity
trees rest during the winter
the circulation of sap is sluggish
there is no creation of leaf blossom or fruit
wild birds and animals after the summer breeding season do little save eat and sleep
some animals and reptiles sleep during the entire winter
even soil must rest to bring the best crop
where it is forced through constant artificial fertilization the product is inferior in flavor and nourishing quality to that raised on virgin soil
disease blight and destructive insects some unknown to vegetation in its natural state
when man recognizes the fact that he cannot use his body year after year from the budding strength of youth to the age of forty or fifty under such a full unceasing pressure of nerve or will power without great injury and when he does recognize the fact that through placing himself oftener in restful and receptive states as do tree bird and animal in their natural state he will then through receiving far more of this element enjoy a far greater health of body elasticity of muscle vigor and brilliancy of mind
he would also have other senses and powers awakened within him whose existence is still doubted by most people
some oriental and indian races have to an extent the uses of these senses and powers partly by reason of their more restful lives and their living like tree and animal more in conformity to the influence on them of the seasons
they have not our domineering aggressive force which invades and conquers for a time as england has conquered india and our own people have subdued and almost exterminated the indian
but mark
this force does not conquer in the end
the thought power which works most while the body is relatively inactive is really the strongest and ultimately prevails
it is subtle noiseless unseen
working with the highest motive it refines and polishes the rude warlike conquering races by grafting on them the civilization of the conquered
in such manner was the art and civilization of conquered egypt transferred to the assyrian
centuries afterward the conquered assyrian transferred this power to conquering greece
greece fell before rome yet grecian civilization held sway in rome
rome fell physically before the goths and vandals the then savage races of northern europe
but in the kingdom of mind it is the influence of ancient italy which has been the great factor in refining the goth hun and vandal of ages ago into the modem german frenchman spaniard and italian
every convulsion agitation and conquest has made this power take root on a wider field
today the best english mind is seriously studying the laws which at last it has recognized in india and that force is in a sense to subdue england for she is already sitting at the feet of india receiving her first lessons in the alphabet of laws and force hitherto quite unrecognized by her learned men
what power is this
you ask  how gained
how developed
it is the power coming of minds united on one purpose in perfect concord and who do not use it all in physical activity
for if you put all your thought or force in the working of the members of your body in working with your hands at any calling day in and day out year in and year out with no regard to the impulses and instincts of times or seasons you keep all that force working merely the instrument the body and wearing it out
you prevent it from operating at a distance from the body
you prevent also the inflowing and assimilation of this recuperative power of spring
you breed the habit of keeping the body always in motion
you prevent yourself from getting that order of sleep which would bring your body the most strength for the waking hours
for if the body or mind is fagged out day after day the same order of thought prevails and is fagging it out by night
you breed the belief and error that you are accomplishing nothing unless at work with body or brain
you cannot get into that state of repose when your thought power could work at a distance and apart from your body and bring you in time a hundred fold more of beneficial result than can ever be realized through mere physical exertion
the quality in the plant’s leaf root or berry which when taken as medicine acts on the internal organs is the force in that plant liberated through the digestive process
the strength you get from bread or meat is force liberated from the food in the same manner
digestion is a slow burning up of the material taken in the body as coal is burned in the boiler and the force freed by such burning you use to work the body as the engineer uses heat to run the engine
the newer the bud the more tender is its outward material formation yet that bud when used medicinally contains the most active force principle and quality of the plant
the choicest and strongest tea is made of the topmost and tenderest buds of the plant
in california the bud of the poison oak affects some people though they only stand near it so great is an injurious force it sends out in the air
the tender buds of spring contain that force which later on will make the more solid leaf or branch
in your own organization in the spring are the same tender budding elements
so if your body is weak in the spring it is a sign that the new buds so to speak within you are forming
they are full of force
but that force has not had time to act on your material organization and form the new bone muscle and sinew which will come at a later period providing such budding or new crystallization be not agitated disturbed and possibly destroyed by undue exertion of mind or body where the same relative damage is done your body as would be done the budding tree by a hurricane
possibly you say but how can I carry on my business and earn my bread if I so lay my body up for nature’s repairs
we answer the laws of man’s business are not the laws of nature
if nature says ‘rest’ and man says ‘work ’ and will work or must work man always gets the worst of it
what society calls vicious practices or habits are not the only agencies which bring disease pain and death
thousands perish annually in lingering agony on respectable beds and in the best society
consumption cancer insanity dropsy rheumatism scrofula fevers rage are ever raging among the most correct people from the conventional standpoint
why is this
if you are in conditions of life where at present it is impossible to give yourself needed rest and you feel thoroughly the need of such rest you may rely upon it that your persistent desire your prayer your imperious demand that you shall have opportunity to receive and profit by nature’s restoring forces will bring you in some way the opportunity to so profit by them
when any need is thoroughly felt the thought and desire coming of such feeling is itself a prayer a force which will bring you helps and take you out of injurious surroundings and modes of life
we repeat this assertion often
it needs frequent repetition
it is the main spring of all growth and advance into a happier and more healthful life
the christ of judea embodied this great law in the words ask and ye shall receive
seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
he wisely made no attempt to explain this mystery whereby earnest human thought desire or aspiration always in time brings the thing or result desired
for this and other mysteries are inexplicable and so fast as any alleged cause is given for any certain result in nature’s workings do we find a deeper mystery in the very cause
we say wind is air in motion
what sets it in motion and keeps it in motion
once we explained the tides on the theory of the moon’s attraction
but apart from the tides what power keeps in motion the gigantic system of currents ever traversing the oceans revealed more fully during the last forty years
what power keeps our lungs breathing day and night or the blood running to every part of the body
are not all of these of the power of god or the infinite spirit or force of good working within you as it works in everything that lives and grows
only to us is at last given the knowledge to work this power intelligently
the body of the tree animal and bird decays at last through lack of such intelligence
so in the past has man’s material part decayed
but this is not always to be
‘‘the last great enemy to be destroyed says paul is death
implying that as man’s knowledge and faith in the wonderful forces about him and in him increased he would discover better and better how to place himself in the line of the working of these forces and in so doing make the mortal part immortal through incessant renewal of finer and finer elements
immortality in the flesh
we believe that immortality in the flesh is a possibility or in other words that a physical body can be retained so long as the spirit desires its use and that these bodies instead of decreasing in strength and vigor as the years go on will increase and its youth will be perpetual
we believe that the reputed fables in the ancient mythologies referring to the immortals or beings possessed of powers other and greater than mortals have a foundation in fact
this possibility must come in accordance with the law that every demand or prayer of humanity must bring supply
there is now a more earnest demand than ever for longer and more perfect physical life because now more minds see the greater possibilities of life
they appreciate more than ever the value of living in the physical
such demand often takes this form of expression I have just learned how to live and it is nearly time for me to die
the body will grow to these results through a gradual series of spiritual processes operating on and ever changing spiritualizing and refining the material
these processes do not retain the body a person may have now
they retain a body and an ever changing and refining body
all disease lack of physical ease or sickness comes of a spiritual process the aim of which is reconstruction of the physical body first in the receiving of new elements and second in the casting out of old ones
back of this physical reconstruction however there is going on the far more important reconstruction of the spirit out of which is built the body
these processes are continually going on with the body operating through the skin the stomach and other organs as well as in the periods of physical prostration or indisposition above referred to
all sickness is an effort of the spirit renewed by fresh influx of force to cast off old and relatively dead matter
but as this intent has not been recognized by the race the spiritual process or effort with its accompanying pain and discomfort has been held and feared as a signal or approach of death
so with no knowledge of spiritual law and judging everything by the material the temporary and necessary weakness of body accompanying the process has been considered an unmitigated ill
such belief has in the past only aided the spirit to pile on itself more and more of belief in the untruth that after a certain term of years no power or force in the universe could prevent the physical body from ageing shriveling weakening and finally perishing
the body is continually changing its elements in accordance with the condition of the mind
in certain mental conditions it is adding to itself elements of decay weakness and physical death
in another mental condition it is adding to itself elements of strength life and perpetual life
that which the spirit takes on in either case are thoughts or beliefs
thoughts and beliefs materialize themselves in flesh and blood
belief in inevitable decay and death brings from the spirit to the body the elements of decay and death
belief in the possibility of an ever coming inflowing to the spirit of life brings life
if new life is being thus added to you there must also be an accompanying throwing off of the old or relatively dead matter of the body just as when an influx of new life comes to the tree in the spring it casts off the dead leaves which may have clung to it all winter
through similar inflowing of new life or force does the animal and bird yearly shed the old fur or feathers and take on the new and correspondent changes take place throughout the whole organization of bird animal and man
this spiritual law works in all forms and organizations of the cruder form of spirit we call matter
in the human being this influx of force is greater than in the lower forms of life
it does not flow equally to all human beings
some receive more than others
but in the course of advancement men and women are to come who will receive so much of this influx as to be obliged to see these further possibilities of existence and also to realize them
when new ideas or thoughts are received by our higher mind or self they are warred against by our lower or material mind
the body is the battle ground between these two forces and therefore suffers
as minds come to trust even to a small extent in the supreme power and entertain the idea that physical disease and physical death are not absolute necessities the higher power must prevail
some old error will be cast out
some new idea will come to stay
the body will be better and stronger after each succeeding struggle and these struggles will also gradually become less and less severe until they cease altogether
people have in the past lost their physical bodies because being in ignorance of the fact that sickness is a process for the spirit to throw off the old material thought and take on new they have used their forces in the wrong way to retain such thought
they retain it by their belief
your belief will make your sickness a benefit or an evil to you
if you can but entertain the belief that it is a spiritual process for getting rid of old worn out elements you assist greatly the mind in the performance of this process
if however you believe that sickness is entirely a physical condition and that no benefit and only evil comes of it you are using force only to load down the spirit with more and more error of which your flesh and blood will be in quality an expression until at last your spirit rejects the body it has been trying to carry and drops its burden
it rejects at last the whole body through the same laws by which it rejects a part of it when that part is spiritually dead
if you receive with scorn the thought that your physical body through fresher and fresher renewal of its substance can be made perpetual you close to yourself an entrance for life and open another to decay and death
we do not argue that you ought to believe this
you may be so mentally constituted that you cannot now believe it
there are many things to be in the future which none of us have now the power to believe
but we can if the thing deemed impossible be desirable pray or demand a faith which shall give us a reason for believing and such faith will come in response to demand
faith means power to believe in the true or the capacity for the mind to receive true thoughts
the faith of columbus in the existence of a new continent was a power in him to entertain such idea greater than others of his time
people who to use the common expression have faith in themselves have also an actual power for carrying out their undertakings greater than those who have no faith in themselves
when you demand faith in possibilities for yourself that now seem new and strange
you demand also the power and ability to draw to you the capacity to see or feel reasons for truths new to you
if you demand persistently the truth and only the truth you will get it and the whole truth means power to accomplish seeming impossibilities
thy faith hath made thee whole said the christ of judea to a man who was healed
to us this passage interprets itself as meaning that the person healed had an innate power of believing that he could be healed
this power which was of his own spirit and not of christ’s so acted on his body as instantly to cure his infirmities
christ was a means of awakening this power in that man’s spirit
but christ himself did not give the person that power
it war latent in the person healed
christ woke it into life and probably only temporary life and activity for we do not hear that any of the recorded cases of sudden healing in those times were permanent
they fell sick again and finally lost their bodies
why
because the faith or power they drew to themselves for a brief time did not come to stay
they had not learned to increase it continually through silent demand of the supreme power
their spirits went back into the domain of material belief
when that belief again materialized a load on the spirit hard to carry and they were sick not one was at hand like the christ to awaken it into a temporary faith or power
no person can become permanently whole which implies among other powers immortality in the flesh and have entire and permanent freedom from disease who is ever trusting or leaning on any other save the supreme to gain the power of faith
in this respect every mind must stand entirely alone
you cannot draw the highest power if you depend always for help from another or others
if you do you are only borrowing or absorbing their faith
such borrowed faith may work wonders for a time but it does not come to stay
when that of which you borrow is cut off you will fall into the slough of despond and disease again
you had really never drawn from the right source the supreme
our most profitable demand or prayer made consciously or unconsciously is let my faith be ever increased
when you reverse your mental attitude regarding sickness and do but entertain the belief that it is an effort of the spirit to throw off errors in thought which as absorbed and received from earliest infancy are materialized in your flesh you gradually cease to load up with error
you commence also the process of unloading and casting out all former errors in thought
the sickness you had many years ago in fear of death has in a sense packed away that particular remembrance of such mood of fear in your being and with it the belief that accompanied such remembrance
that belief has been working against you all these years as all wrong belief must work against you
it is literally a part of your real being as all past individual remembrances and experiences are a literal part of our beings
it is retained in your spiritual memory although its material remembrance may have faded out
that remembrance is in thought a reality
but it is the remembrance of a false belief teaching that death and decay can never be overcome
this belief the reversed action and state of your mind will cast out
but such casting out must have a correspondent expression in the flesh
the physical expressions of all your former coughs and colds fevers and other illness must reappear at first possibly severe but gradually in a modified form
you are then unloading your old false beliefs
but if your belief is not reversed and you go on as before regarding physical decay and death as inevitable then with every illness in such mental condition you pack away another error another untruth and another addition to the load of untruths whose certain effect added to the rest is to weaken crush and finally cause the body to perish
there is no period in the physical life too late for receiving or entertaining the truth
there is no period too late for such truth to commence its process of physical renewal and though that particular physical life may not be perpetuated yet the spirit in receiving such truth receives a force which will be of priceless value to it on the unseen side and by its aid it may be able the sooner to build for itself a more perfect spiritual body and the ultimate of the relatively perfected spiritual body is the power to be and live in the physical and spiritual realms of existence at will
if you hold to the idea that mankind are always to go on as in the past losing their bodies and are also to remain without the power to keep those bodies in perfect health then you set your belief against the eternal fact that all things in this planet are ever moving forward to greater refinement greater powers and greater possibilities
medicine and material remedies may greatly assist the throwing off process
a skilled and sympathetic physician of any school may be of much assistance
everything depends on the mind and belief in which you take the medicine and the physician’s advice
if you regard both as aids to your spirit in throwing off a load and building for you a new body you give in such belief great help to the spirit so to throw off and build
but if you regard both medicine and physician as aids only to the body and a body also which you hold must at best weaken and perish some time during the next thirty forty or fifty years you will load up with belief in error faster than you cast it off and the load becomes at last too heavy for the spirit to carry
what causes the man or woman to be bowed down by age
what causes the stooping shoulders the weakened knees and the tottering gait
because they believe only in the earthly and perishable
the spirit is neither earthly nor perishable
but you can load it down literally with an earthy quality of thought which will bow it down toward the earth with such burden
it is not the physical body of the old person that is bent and bowed down
it is that part which is the force moving the body that is his or her spirit loaded with material thought which it cannot appropriate or assimilate which becomes so bent bowed and weak
the body is always an external correspondence of your mind or spirit
a body thus ever renewing beautifying freshening and strengthening means a mind behind it ever renewing with new ideas plans hope purpose and aspiration
life eternal is not the half dead life of extreme old age
the person who can see only the physical side and temporary expression of life who eats and drinks in the belief that only the body is affected by less eating and drinking who believes that the body is sustained only by force generated within itself and that it is not fed of an unseen element coming from the spiritual realm of element and who believes that nothing exists but what he can see hear and feel with the physical sense that is the material which is always the temporary and perishable draws to himself mostly those forces and elements which cause the temporary and perishable and these acting in his body make it temporary and perishable
death of the body begins with thousands many years before they are in their coffins
the pale face and parchment colored skin means a half dead skin
it means a portion of the body on which the spirit works the casting out process of dead element and taking on of the new very imperfectly
in the freshness of infancy and early youth the spirit cast out and took on more vigorously
as years went on untruth was absorbed by that spirit
its growth in knowledge was more and more retarded
responding physical changes became slower and slower
the body commences to show signs of age that is to die
because such spirit was less and less fed of that element which brings constant renewal of new thought which is new life
so far does the belief and faith in weakness and decay prevail with the race that wisdom is often allegorically portrayed as an old man gray baldheaded bowed and sustained by a staff
that means a wisdom which cannot prevent its own body from falling to pieces
in that form of being we call the child a spirit or mind having come in possession of a new body there is for a period a greater spiritual wisdom than when the child is physically more matured
it is the unconscious wisdom of intuition
it is for a time more open to the truth
for such reason up to the age of eighteen or twenty the spiritual casting off and taking on processes with the body are more perfectly performed
these relatively rapid changes in the physical maintain the bloom and freshness of youth
sooner or later however the higher spiritual process ceases gradually to operate
beliefs in the false as taught or absorbed from others materialize themselves in the body despite all the resistance of the higher mind as expressed in pain and sickness
the load of belief in the earthy and perishable accumulates
the body assumes an appearance in correspondence with such thought
at last the higher mind refuses longer to carry such a burden flings it off and leaves a dead body
the death of the body is then the final process for casting off cruder element from the spirit which it can no longer use or appropriate
but it is very desirable for the spirit to be able to keep a physical body which shall refine as the spirit refines because in such equality of refinement between the spirit and its instrument our increase in happiness is greatly advanced and the relatively perfected rounding out of our powers cannot be realized until this union between spirit and body is effected
when the christ of judea said to the elders of israel of the little child except ye become as this child ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven he meant as the text interprets itself to us that they should become as open to that inflowing of force as that spirit the child was at that period of its existence
were such influx maintained the youth of the body would be perpetual
the child is more led of the spirit than the grown up person
it is more natural
it discards policy
it shows openly whom it likes and whom it does not
it has often more intuition
it will dislike a bad man or a bad woman when its parents see no evil in that person
it knows or rather feels far more regarding life than its parents give it credit for
but it cannot voice its thoughts in words
yet the thoughts are still there
it has not learned to train itself to the double faced custom of the world which smiles in your face and sneers behind your back
it is relatively natural
its spirit for a time gives itself free expression
when the spirit loses this freedom of expression when we pretend what we are not when we say yes outwardly and think no inwardly when we court only to gain a favor when we feel anger or disappointment or irritation within and pretend content and happiness without we become more and more unnatural in all tastes and desires
we blunt and for a time destroy all the higher spiritual senses and powers
we become unable to distinguish truth from falsehood
we are unable to feel spiritually what faith means much less to draw this great and indispensable power to us and without this drawing power the physical body must be cast off by the spirit
the body in dying does not give up the ghost
it is the ghost the spirit that rejects the material body
its spirit through casting off unbelief becomes more and more accessible to thoughts and things that are true and therefore grows to more and more power it will acting in all parts and functions of the body operate the casting off process more and more quickly as it does in the material youth
it will refuse or reject through the physical senses of touch or taste anything which would injure or adulterate it
it can attain to such power that an active poison if accidentally placed in the mouth would be instantly detected and rejected or it swallowed would be instantly cast from the stomach
it is not the physical stomach which rejects food unfit for it or casts out the nauseous dose
it is the spirit which moves the organ to such action through a knowledge of its own that the cast out substance is unfit for it
it is so unfit because there is no spirit nor quality in the rejected element which can assimilate with and help the spirit
as your spirit grows in power this sensitiveness to all things which can do it evil be they of the seen or unseen world of things will increase
it grows keener and keener to the approach or presence of everything evil and casts it off
it will warn you instantly of the evil or designing person
it will tell you what is safe and fit for your association
it will at last cast out or refuse to receive all evil thoughts which now you may daily receive unconsciously and which work more harm than anything material can do for by them the spirit is poisoned
as faith increases many material aids will be called in by the spirit which will greatly help the renewing processes
these aids will come in the selection of foods in choosing proper associations and other changes of habit and custom
but it is the spirit which must prompt and direct these material aids
when such prompting comes you will be obliged to follow it
the food to be avoided you will not be able to eat
your taste will reject it
the association injurious to you you will not be able to keep company with
the habit to be changed will drop off easily and naturally
but if you make any rigid rules for yourself in these matters in the hope they will tend to spiritualize you you are allowing the material self to take the matter in hand
the material or lower mind is then trying to give the law and rule and refine the spiritual or higher self
let the spirit increased in faith do the work and when the time comes for you to reject any animal food or any of the grosser element in any form the desire and relish for these will have gone
in stating our belief that immortality in the flesh is a possibility we do not infer that it is one which any now physically alive may realize
neither do we infer it is one they cannot realize
nor do we argue that people should immediately set to work in any material sense in order to live forever
we hold only that it is one result which must come sooner or later of that spirit evolution or growth from the cruder to the finer which has always been operating on this planet and on every form of matter
matter is spirit temporarily materialized so as to be evident to correspondent physical sense
as we grow in the faith of these spiritual processes for casting out the old and taking in the new and consequently realize the accompanying greater refinement or spiritualization of the body we shall aid more and more those who are nearest us in the unseen side of life
for as we become more spiritualized in the flesh they are helped to materialize more of the spirit
in other words we shall become physically tangible each to the other because in the material thought we cast off there exists an element which they can appropriate to make themselves more material
their spiritual bodies are also under the same laws as regards the throwing off and taking on process
what they throw off as coarser to them is the finer and fit for us this element we spiritually absorb
it is for the time and condition a certain spiritual food and life for us
through what they throw off we are aided to spiritualize the body
through what we throw off they are aided to materialize the spirit
the attraction of aspiration
why may we not maintain a level of serenity of mind
why are we so subject to periods of depression
it is because no matter how well positioned you are in accord with your ideal of living you are still to a greater or less degree affected by the discordance which reigns about you
are you gentle and humane toward the animal creation
the wild birds your free pets who come and build their nests in the grove are murdered for sport or gain before your eyes and you are quite helpless to prevent it
you live amid a scene of incessant cruelty and slaughter
the animals fostered by man’s care are bred under artificial conditions and thereby developed into unnatural and really unhealthy growths for his amusement or profit
this refers to all manner of fancy breeding
nature when left alone does best for bird or animal and the birds or animals have their individual rights as well as man
a strained and morbid taste will grow an enlarged and diseased liver in a goose to make thereof a certain dish
your race are so growing disease all about you
disease means mental as well as physical unhappiness
directly and indirectly this unhappiness affects you
the finer your organization and the more open is it to a finer life the more easily annoyed is it here by the many ills about it
you can hardly go abroad without suffering mental or physical pain
your houses cars and boats in winter are overheated and full of noxious vapors from the fuel used as well as emanation from the human bodies packed in them
you may be obliged to sleep in rooms where this unhealthy heat is partly relied on to warm your when at rest
you must breathe it when in the unconscious state of recuperation and awake with it incorporated into your being
you are liable to eat staleness and decay at the best of your public tables
you are pained by scenes of cruelty brutality and injustice
that is the predominant thought active in the atmosphere of the crowd and it affects your thought
there is thought or if you please so to call it mental action embodied in every material thing about you and the brightness or darkness of the thought depends on the condition of the material thing
the eating of stale fruit or vegetables may indirectly give you the blues
the live fresh fruit gives you life
decay is the disorganization of matter
you want to feed on the perfect organization neither over nor under ripe
you want it if possible when the article fed upon is at its fullest stage of life so that you may receive that life
you violate ignorantly unconsciously and even for the time necessarily many laws of physical and mental health
relative to food air warmth as spoken of above you may always have been dependent on artificial props
you were born so dependent
you may have come into the world with a body the partial development of artificial and improper food and an artificial life brought down to you through the blood of many generations
this artificial life must in some way bring pain
your alcoholic stimulant brightens for the moment but leaves a much longer period of pain behind it
but the evil of alcohol is really small as compared with scores of causes for human ills in daily active operation about you in places crowded with people and all the more dangerous from being quite unknown
you ask why even in solitude you cannot maintain a certain evenness and serenity of mind of which you realize sufficient to long for
assuming that in the past you have been diseased physically and of course mentally do you expect to be instantly cured of such a long illness
certain habits of thought cannot be otherwise than gradually removed
so with certain habits of body consequent on such habits of thought such as the habit of hurry the habit of worry the habit of laying undue stress on things not the most needful for the hour
the habit of trouble borrowing and many others which permeate and influence every act of life
their combined effect is exhaustion and exhaustion is the real mother of most of the ills flesh is heir to
whatever exhausts the body be the motive for effort of good or ill benevolence or selfishness lessens the power to resist these many causes for pain and consequent depression of spirits
so long as earthiness or grosser spirit has the ascendancy we see mostly on the earth side
we sense mostly the repulsive in the individual
we are slow to see the good
we can like but few
we dislike many
but when spirit gains the ascendancy this is reversed
we see then clearly the good in all
we are thereby attracted more or less to all
and as we find the good in all we get good from all
we cease then to be so strongly repelled by individual prejudices
we love more than we hate
while earthiness prevails we hate more than we love
we see more to loathe and detest than to admire
we are blinded to the good and too sensitive to the evil
seeing and feeling then more of evil than good we are injured by it
to hate to be strongly prejudiced to be unable to hear mention of the loathed person’s name without a thrill of indignation or disgust is to be continually inflicting wounds on self
to be able to admire to have the clear sight to detect the good in the lowest nature and to keep the evil out of sight is a source to us of strength of health of continual increase of power
love is power
you are always the stronger when in a condition of admiration
attraction is the law of heaven repulsion that of earth
spirituality is attracted to what it finds of itself anywhere
it sees the diamond in the rough though embedded in the coarsest mould
it sees the germ of superior quality in the coarsest nature
it can fix its eye on that germ and hide from itself the coarser elements
in so doing it throws its power on that germ and warms it into life
the basest nature mounts to its highest level in the presence and under the influence of the higher
there is little need for the true missionary to preach in words
he or she exhales an atmosphere of divinity which is felt by all
precepts need to be felt more than heard
the prejudiced against the sinner is only a spiritual porcupine
he stings all he touches
so long as we feel that strong repulsion through seeing only the defects in another so long are we ruled by such sentiment
we are in fetters
we are in his or her presence so full of hatred as to be unable to assert the better part of ourselves
all our own evil is called out and comes to the front
there is only the clashing of opposing wills
in such case we though in reality the more powerful party become the weaker for the time being
we are obliged to allow the pupil whom we should teach by example to domineer over us
cynicism is born of repulsion and personal prejudice carried to its extreme
the cynic ends by finding everybody unbearable and at last hates himself
no cynic was ever in good health
cynicism is blood poisoning
the cynic is ever hunting for the ideal without
he should find it within
this when once found would be ever creating ideals from all without
his own loving spirit would graft and build itself or all with whom he came in contact
divinity is also contagious
that would be a poor divine plan which allowed only evil to be infectious
goodness is catching
in good time the world will learn that health is also
but hitherto mankind have so much feared and even admired the devil as to have accredited evil only with inoculating quality while all manner of good is supposed to be drilled into poor human nature by painful and laborious processes
there cannot be the highest health and vigor without aspiration and purity of thought
pure thought brings the purest blood
impure thought despondent hopeless repining fault finding fretful slanderous thought is certain to make the blood impure and fill the system with disease
without aspiration your best care for the body will be relatively of little help
you may as to garb and person be scrupulously clean
you may pay the utmost attention to diet
yet after all you are but cleaning the outside of a vessel which within is ever filling up with uncleanliness
with an ever increasing purity of thought cleanliness and care for the body will come as a natural result
the vessel will clean itself
proper care for the body in all respects will be a loving effort for that body
bathing will not be an enforced task but a recreation
diet will be regulated by the natural demand of appetite
taste or relish will be the standard for acceptance or rejection
excess will be impossible so watchful will be the healthy palate to regard the first faint sign of sufficiency as the signal to cease any kind of indulgence
it is this aspiration for the highest and best that in time causes an actual new birth of the body a total reformation throughout in the quality and composition of flesh bone blood muscle and sinews
a change in the material organization corresponding with that of the spiritual
the flesh by it is spiritualized that is made up of finer elements
in all aspiring minds is this process going on
the rule of spirit over flesh brings perfect immunity from disease intensifies every power gives far greater capacity for effort in any field and at the close of the earth life ensures a painless passing out of the spirit a simple falling to sleep of the earthly body and a waking up on the other the spiritual side of life
the path of self healing lies in the calling for the elements of health and strength to drive out disease
that is you pray for such elements and they come to you
strength or vigor is an element of spirit or more refined matter
the more often is your will exercised in praying for it the quicker will it come
this is the secret for the perpetual maintenance and increase of vigor or any other desired quality
when sensible by signs quickly detected of lack of power call pray desire more
its rapport with the elements causes such power immediately to flow in upon it
you may become weary
your will put thus in operation causes an immediate influx of strength as soon as it places itself in certain conditions for such inflowing
say you arise in the morning weak languid with no physical or mental energy
keep your mind as much as you can from dwelling on your ailment
keep it as much as you can on the thought of strength vigor health activity
as aids to erect this frame of mind fix it as much as you can on illustrations and symbols of nature’s force and power on storm and tempest on the heaving billow and majesty of the ocean on the morning sun rising in all his glory to refresh and invigorate man animal and vegetation
if there be in prose or poetry any illustrations of this character which affect you strongly recur to them
read them aloud or in silence
because in so doing you are setting the mind in the right direction to receive strength
in brief think of strength and power and you will draw it to you
think of health and you get it
let your mind dwell on weakness on never getting well on the dark side on everything of discouragement gloom and darkness and you draw to you the contrary and hurtful elements
as decay attracts and generates decay in the things we see so does any weak decaying order of thought attract its like of the things we do not see
unconsciously many sick and ailing people nurse their complaints more than they nurse the bodies carrying such complaints
they are always thinking of them and talking of them
they actually crave sympathy for the hurt more than for the body afflicted with it
and the sympathy so brought out from surrounding friends actually nourishes the injury and increases the ailment when the thought of patient and friends should be placed on a strong healthy body for the patient
the more of such thought concentrated on the patient from those about him or her the more of drawing power you have to bring vigor to the one afflicted
bear in mind it is not here argued that such relief can always be immediate
a mind long unconsciously set in the opposite direction of dwelling on self weakness cannot immediately reverse its movement and set itself in the contrary and strength drawing direction
it may have become so habituated and trained to dwell on the dark side as to be almost unable to fix itself on any other
but as the attempt is made and persisted in more and more power will come to put it in the desired strength attracting frame
the effort must be made
it may take time but every atom of effort so made is an accretion of strength which can never be lost
do not demand arbitrarily or despotically that any member of your body get well of a hurt that any organ or function become stronger
your body is as a whole an individual separate from your spirit and with a peculiar physical life of its own as a whole it is an organization made up of a number of other organizations each charged with a specific duty as the eye to see the ear to hear the tongue to taste the stomach to digest the lungs to breathe
all of these are in a sense individual organizations
each is open to the enlivening cheering effect upon it of the element called love and that element you can send it
bandage a hurt lovingly tenderly and the element not only inspires the careful tender treatment but it goes into the hurt
it acts as a salve and a strength
it gradually binds and unites the ruptured parts
bind it with indifference bind or wash it as an irksome task and the sentiment inspires not only a careless and even rough treatment but fails so to salve and strengthen it with the needed element love
bind it with actual hatred and you are self poisoning the part affected
hate is the element of poison love of healing
the same principle and process applies to the weak eye the deafened ear or any ailing or weak organ
will at times your affection direct to the ailing member and in that spirit ask it to recover its strength
be not deterred by the apparent simplicity of this statement but try it
if you are impatient or angry at eye or ear for not being perfect in their office you do but throw that element of impatience on those organs
you fret and annoy them in their efforts to do their best
there is as yet no such thing as a relatively perfected life among our race
because such a life means a life and a body without disease or pain and also a life without the present form of death to the body
a relatively perfected life means a life whereby a mind or spirit has grown to or gathered so much power by simply asking or praying for power
or in other words setting that mind as a magnet in the proper attitude to attract power that it shall be able constantly to recuperate or make over the body with fresher newer and finer material and also to put this body on or take it off materialize it at pleasure as did the christ immediately after his crucifixion
the jews had only destroyed his material body
the spirit of christ had power to re clothe itself with a new body
of this another record illustration is the prophet elijah’s translation to heaven
that which his companion elisha saw was elijah’s spiritual or finer body the counterpart of his material body and this body was of such fine element that it had come into the domain of and could make use of an attraction not yet recognized by our scientists the attraction or power which draws upward the opposite of the attraction of gravitation which draws downward or toward the earth
the attraction of aspiration
every thought or desire of ours to be nobler more refined more free from malice ill will to others and to do others good without exacting conditions is a thing a force of unseen element which does actually tend or draw upward or in other words away from the earth or any form of that cruder type of spirit seen of the physical eye or apparent to the body’s touch which we call matter
this the aspiring order of thought you draw from the higher realms of spirit or element every time you wish pray or desire it
you are drawing to you then that of unseen element which incorporates itself with your body and spirit and it then commences literally to draw you toward the realm and element of greater broader purer life existent in zones or bands about our planet
it will as you persist in this aspiring thought make you stand more erect
the phrase the upright man or woman implies that the effect of this unseen element so brought you of aspiration makes you physically as well as spiritually upright
it lifts every physical organ into place
it is the thought current drawing from above the mood of impure or immature thoughts the mood of unwise or personal selfishness which seeks only personal gratification without thought or care of others
the thought or mood of gloom discouragement and self depreciation comes of the overruling attraction of earthly seen or physical things
when you are ruled by the attraction of gravitation or in other words the attraction of material things it will tend to make your shoulders rounded he and stooping your head bowed and your eye down  cast
your heart will also in some way be literally bowed down through grief or worry or anger or some form of immature thought or attraction coming of seen things or cruder forms of spirit
every organ of the body will be similarly displaced and tend toward the earth
there is always between things and forms material and things and forms spiritual an exact and literal correspondence
the shape of every man and woman’s body the expression of the face their every gesture and mannerism to the crook of a finger and their physical health is an exact correspondence of their spiritual condition or in other words of the state of their minds
it is a duplication in seen matter and movement of what they are thinking in unseen matter
as you are ruled more and more by the attraction of aspiration the desire to be more and more of a god or goddess the determination to conquer all the evil within you which is the only way to conquer any and all evil outside of you your form will in accordance grow more upright your eye will be more open and uplifted your heart will be lifted up your cheeks will bloom with fresher color your blood will fill more and more with a finer and powerful element giving to your limbs strength vigor suppleness and elasticity of movement
you are then filling more and more with the elixir of life which is no myth but a spiritual reality and possibility
our race hitherto has been dominated by the attraction of physical things or seen element
it has said there is nothing in existence but what can be seen or felt of the outer inferior or coarser senses and consequently there has been nothing else to us
a man may perish of thirst surrounded by springs of cool water and if he know not of such springs there are none for him
our condition has been analogous to that
with the more perfected race of the future on this planet there will be no painful death of the body as at present
every such painful death is the direct result of sin and transgression of the law of life
the ending of the body of the future will be the birth or development of a new physical body for which the old one shall serve as a shell or envelope until the new one is ripe and ready to come forth in a manner analogous to the development of the moth or butterfly from the cocoon
such growths and transitions will take place at lesser and lesser intervals until at last the spirit will grow to such power that it can will and attract to itself instantly out of surrounding elements a body to use so long as it pleases on this stratum of life this is the condition foreseen by paul when he said o
death where is thy sting
o grave where is thy victory
and again where he writes the last great enemy which shall be overcome is death
we quote paul because no ancient teacher has more plainly foreshadowed these possibilities than he
undoubtedly they were known to others both of the recorded and unrecorded human history of this planet which stretches back to periods far more remote than those inferred in the mosaic creation
these truths these possibilities for avoiding decay death and pain and growing into and taking on a newer and newer body and newer fresher and more vigorous life vitally affect us of today
we must not regard these statements as affecting only a coming race of people of some far distant future they affect us
they are possibilities for us
we have belonging to us the powers for bringing to us new rife and new bodies
if you are not told of these your powers how can you ever use them
you are then as a pauper having unknown to yourself a thousand dollar bank note sewed up in the lining of your ragged coat
this knowledge is for you the pearl of great price
you cannot sell this pearl
you cannot trade it for that of your neighbor’s
you cannot accumulate your neighbor’s powers
you can only grow and use yours alone
you wonder perhaps and say can these truths these marvels belong to our common  place age and time
but ours is not a common place or prosaic age and time
it is only our lack of seeing clearly which may make our time seem common place
we live surrounded by the same elements and we are in possession of the same powers to greater or lesser extent whereby the three young jews passed unharmed through the fiery furnace whereby the prophet daniel through exercise of the superior force of human thought quelled the ferocity of the lions in the den
whereby paul shook off the serpent’s venom
whereby the man of nazareth performed his wonderful works
was not this god’s power
you ask
yes the power of god or the infinite and incomprehensible spirit of eternal good working in and through these his children as the same power can work in and through us the more we call it to us demand it importune it and depend upon it
it is simply the power of the higher mind over the lower or cruder mind
all seen element or as we call it matter is expression of the lower or cruder mind
rocks hills clouds waves trees animals and men are all varying expressions of the lower cruder mind
the power of mind over matter means the power of the higher mind over all these expressions of the lower mind
the aspiration the earnest prayer or demand to be better to have more power to become more refined will bring more and more of the finer elements and forces
that is spirit to you
but the motive must be the natural heart felt zealous wish to impart what you receive to others
you cannot call the fullness of this power to you if you intend living only for self
you may get it to a degree and accomplish much by it
your demand if living only for self may bring to you houses wealth and fame
but the demand based on the selfish motive will in the end bring only pain disease and disappointment
the accession of new thought
new thought is new life
when an invention a discovery first breaks on the inventor’s mind it fills him with joy
the blood in his veins surges with a fresher impetus
the author or poet is lifted into ecstasy of emotion by a new conception
I mean the relatively few creative authors and poets not the many who borrowing the fire of genius put it in their own lanterns and pass it off often successfully as their own
a piece of good news as we term it in a period of gloom depression discouragement
the possible realization of a hope the removal of an ill or danger is but a thought after all is but the picture in the mind of the thing desired is not the thing itself yet how it brings strength to the whole body
an entertaining spectacle a drama so perfectly acted as to absorb all one’s attention an interview with one to whom we are strongly attracted a pursuit or exercise or art which interests and fascinates all these are as food and nourishment stimulation to the body and in the absorption or excitement of the moment hunger for material food may pass away or be forgotten
so we do not live by bread alone
but our natures demand ever new and newer food of thought
the play so charming when first seen may become tiresome through repetition
the air so fascinating when first heard becomes worn through familiarity
there may even be longed for a change from the quality of the thought of the mind most attractive to us
I mean for all these a change but only for a time
the play the opera the artist may in time be seen again and with increase of pleasure either from the influence of former association or from new growths and shadings in the artist’s rendering or from new capacity in ourselves to see what we could not see before
call then all new thought and if you please new emotion food food as necessary to make the relatively perfect physical and mental man or woman as is the bread we eat
we desire ever fresh food
we similarly desire and need always new and fresh thought
old thought constant repetition of the same thought involves decay sluggishness of mind sluggishness of body
suppose that we rose each morn with the absolute certainty that each day was to be a day involving to us more or less of the excitement of discovery in something useful and enjoyable and also of similar use to others   something endurable for us and others   endurable for eternity some unexpected branching out of yesterday’s truth which for yesterday seemed fully grown something telling us how life may be made still fuller of durable and harmless enjoyment
some great law principle in nature recognized possibly for the first time in some heretofore called little thing in the fall of a leaf in the coloring of a leaf by the autumnal frost in its almost equal vividness of color coming through the heat of spring
what must be the pleasure to an open and receptive mind to find today an increase of improvement in the quality almost despaired of yesterday an increase of patience in doing the perplexing work  an increase of courage an increase of perception to see beauty in what yesterday it passed by with indifference an increase of power to control unruly appetite an increase of power to drive away unpleasant and therefore injurious thought
would not such be encouraging cheering life giving health giving thoughts
this order and accession of ever new thought knows no stop in any direction
it says
are you orderly today
you will find some power and room and capacity to be more orderly tomorrow
was your last effort in music in painting in composition in acting in oratory your greatest triumph
you will find some way of making it more perfect tomorrow
that will take nothing from the last effort
it is only a more beautiful and delicate tint for some already beautiful picture
the consciousness of such never ending growth of improvement is also food for the growing mind other than bread
yet it is bread
it is the bread of life and to be desired as our daily bread
would not also the thought each morning that a great power an infinitely wise mind was always ready to give more knowledge to help you through troubles troubles from without and troubles from within
would not such thought and the trust begotten of it be as food strength and healthy stimulation
especially when the reality of this power and its ability to aid had been proven to you many times so that the hope had become a conviction
grant that new thought is healthy stimulation and also a necessary food to a more perfected life and the question arrives
how shall we get it
in other words how may we attune ourselves or how may we become more receptive to all that is beautiful and useful in nature
for in our religion the useful always implies the beautiful
it is almost farcical to answer live a pure life
that implies so much
so much in so many cases to be done
so much of inherent tendency to be outgrown
so many difficulties to be met
so many conditions necessary for such life so difficult to make
the desire for accumulation seems a law of our natures
in its cruder working it accumulates money
in its higher form it would accumulate powers and qualities of mind
I am or richer than I was this morning says with satisfaction and pleasure at night the money accumulator
that pleasant thought is to him a bit of the bread of life but not of enduring life or in the end if at all healthy life
I may say another man at night am richer than I was this morning by so much more patience by a bit more of skill or dexterity in my art by certain knowledge of which I knew nothing twenty four hours ago
are we yet fully awakened to the thought that we are receptacles for thought and with thought knowledge and with knowledge power and that our capacity for receiving all these may be limitless and that the supply of knowledge power new thought in the universe is limitless also and that it is all ours to draw from and that the bank can no more break than eternity can end
there are thousands of things events and scenes in your past life which it is more profitable to forget than to remember
by so forgetting you allow entrance for new idea which is new life
by remembering you prevent the coming to you of such new idea and life
by forgetting I mean that you should avoid living in unpleasant past scenes and remembrances
absolutely to forget or wipe out completely from memory anything it has once taken note of is impossible
for everything you have seen learned sensed or heard is stored away and is capable under certain circumstances of being brought to view again
in place of the term forgetting it would be better to say you should cultivate the power of driving from your mind and putting out of sight whatever makes you feel unhappy or whatever you discover that is unprofitable to remember
it is impossible absolutely to wipe out anything your memory has once written on its tablets for whatever the scene event or experience may have been it has become a part of your real self or spirit
in other words your spirit is made up of all its experiences and consequent remembrances extending to an infinite past
of these some are vivid some vague and much is buried out of present sight but capable under certain circumstances of being called to remembrance
to destroy such remembrance if possible would be to destroy so much of your mind
all experiences are valuable for the wisdom they bring or suggest
but when you have once gained wisdom and knowledge from any experience there is little profit in repeating it especially if it has been unpleasant you do actually repeat it when you remember it or live it over again in thought
this is what people are doing who brood over past misfortunes and disappointments
it is what people are doing when they recall with regret their youth as bright and joyous as compared with the gloom of their middle or old age
live in the pleasant remembrance of your youth if you so desire
that will do you good
but do not set it in its brightness and freshness against a dark background of the present
do not think of it in that vein
remember that the time of your infancy and youth with all its freshness and newness was also the time of some other people’s old age when the world seemed stale and joyless when to them all that life seemed capable of yielding seemed exhausted when nothing seemed to remain but to wither and die
remember also that today if the world seems less bright than formerly if the sun seems setting instead of rising it seems now to the boy and girl of ten or fifteen as it did to you at that age
no person could hold his or her physical body and enjoy life who as they lived on lived in the past and refused to set or open their minds to the future
in so doing they accumulate more and more of the old and relatively lifeless thought and this element materializes itself on the body
their flesh bone and blood then become an actual expression of the dead and inert spirit
to live carrying such an ever increasing load must result only in weakness and misery so long as the spirit can carry it
but the mind rejecting the old which it has no use for and ever pressing on to the new adds the new thought to itself and this newness of idea will materialize a newer body
you do actually make the things before pleasant or unpleasant for you according as you think of them in advance
there is a class of people who if in difficulties and anyone suggests a way out instantly raise objections and find difficulties in the plan proposed
when in thought we so find difficulties we actually make them
to lay awake nights and brood devise turn over or invent possible coming troubles is force and industry ill employed in preparing the way for those troubles
in all business we must press on in mind to the successful result
we must see in mind or imagination the thing we plan completed the system or method organized and in working order the movement or undertaking advancing and ever growing stronger and more profitable
to spend time and force in looking back and living past troubles or obstacles over again and out of such living and mental action to conjure more difficulties or oppositions is literally to spend time and force in destroying your undertaking or in manufacturing obstacles to put in your own way
forgetting the things behind and pressing on to those before is a maxim having a thousand intensely practical applications
every business success is founded on it
men who cease to live in old methods and press forward to new achieve the greatest financial success
but men who having started out during their physical youth with the new allow themselves with advancing years to hold on to what was new in their youth but which is relatively old now are really on the back track
money may continue to pour in upon them but their methods are really out of date and a few more years will see their business superseded by the newer system
if you were debilitated weak or sick yesterday at any hour do not commence today with living in thought in the same weakness or debility at that hour
forget it live away from it and press onward to the thought of being strong well and vigorous at that hour
when you in mind look behind and live behind the thought of the sickness weakness or indisposition of yesterday you are actually making the conditions for having the same physical troubles
when you at the day’s commencement in thought look before to the new thing the thought of health and strength at the time your lack of vigor commenced you are making the conditions for realizing such health and strength
if it does not come the first day of such trial try the next and the next after that
the state you seek will come in time
perhaps you say to me in mind
but how can you prove these assertions
they have not been realized in our time
decay and death at last overtake all
you can commence yourself to prove them
if you experiment with any of the methods here suggested for working thought to profitable result and you prove for yourself ever so little you must thereby gain some faith in this law
if the law is by you proven a little is it unreasonable to say it will prove more if followed in this direction
unreasoning prejudices are bred out of this continual living in the past
the man of sixty or seventy often lives in moods usages and customs peculiar to his youth
he accepts these as the most fit and proper thing for him
he would probably regard with disfavor and prejudice the man who at his daily business should wear the knee breeches stockings waistcoat ruffled shirt and cocked hat of the eighteenth century
yet such style was common one hundred years ago
his great grandfather probably wore such a suit
yet his great grandfather would probably have regarded with the same disfavor and prejudice the man dressed in the fashion of today
so a few years relatively have begotten these two unreasoning prejudices with the great grandfather and great grandson founded only on the fact that they were fashions peculiar to the youth of each
it is of course impossible for a person to fly in the face of popular custom or usage to dress differently or in certain ways live differently without bringing on him unpleasant and even injurious results
for the action of many minds sending toward you ever the thought of prejudice dislike or ridicule would tend to injure mind and body
but the sentiment which sends this kind of thought toward another who departs from any established custom when that person thereby affects no one’s peace or comfort is a gross error
it is an unreasoning mental tyranny which so regards with hostile mind a man who should today adopt the costume of the ancient greeks a garb by the way more sensible and comfortable than ours
less than two hundred years ago such a sentiment mobbed the man in england who carried the first umbrella
this sentiment comes of that fossilized condition of mind which persists in living in the things that are behind and averts itself from such as are before
life is a continual advance forward
if we are advancing forward it is better to look forward
and all are advancing even the dullest the grossest and most perverse
a mighty eternal and incomprehensible force pushes us all forward
but while all are so being pushed many linger and look back
unconsciously they oppose this force
so to do is to court evil pain disease and distress
whatever the mind is set upon or whatever it keeps most in view that it is bringing to it and the continual thought or imagining must at last take form and shape in the world of seen and tangible things
I repeat this assertion often in these books and in various forms of expression because this fact is the cornerstone of your happiness or misery permanent health and prosperity or poverty
it needs to be kept as much as possible in mind
our thought is the unseen magnet ever attracting its correspondence in things seen and tangible
as we realize this more and more clearly we shall become more and more careful to keep our minds set in the right direction
we shall be more and more careful to think happiness and success instead of misery and failure
it is very wonderful that the happiness or misery of our lives should be based on what seems so simple a law and method
but so called simple things in nature on investigation generally turn out incomprehensible and ever deepening mysteries
what most concerns us is to know a cause or agency that will produce a given result
when we realize that we can and do think ourselves into what we are as regards health wealth and position we realize also that we have found in ourselves the pearl of great price and we hasten to tell our neighbor that he may seek and find in himself this pearl and power also for no one is made poorer through his finding that which can belong to him alone and all are made richer and happier as each finds his or her pearl through the power it gives them to add to the general wealth and happiness
life is fuller of possibilities for pleasure than has ever been realized
the real life means a perpetual and ever increasing maturity
it means the preservation of the physical body so that it can be used on this stratum of existence whenever the spirit desires to use it
it means the preservation of that body not only free from pain and sickness but free from the debility weakness and decay of what we call old age which is in reality only the wearing out of the instrument used by the spirit for lack of knowledge to ever recuperate and regenerate it
life means the development in us of powers and pleasures which fiction in its highest flights has never touched
it means an ever increasing freshness an ever increasing perception and realization of all that is grand wonderful and beautiful in the universe a constantly increasing discovery of more and more that is grand beautiful and wonderful and a constantly increasing capacity for the emotional part of our natures to sense such happiness
life is eternal in the discovery and realization of these joys
their source is inexhaustible
their quality and character must be unknown until they reach us
in the words of the apostolic record eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him
in so called ordinary things we get out of our lives and our senses but the merest fragment of the pleasure they can be made capable of giving us
our food is capable of giving far more pleasure to the sense of taste than it may now
we do not get nearly as much pleasure from the ear and eye as they are capable of giving
with bodies more highly developed and refined food when taken into the stomach should act as a healthy stimulant and give that impulse vigor and bounding life which it gives to the young animal
the movement of every muscle as in walking can be made to give pleasure
through following the spiritual law that peace of mind which passeth all understanding is in the future to come to many
that it has not in the past been realized is no proof it will not be
life then whether its forces are in activity or at rest will ne perpetual elysium
but millions of our race do not look forward to such joyous possibilities at all
they have never heard of them
the great majority would not believe did they hear of them
they press on in mind to what
to a belief which grows stronger with years that life is short that old age and decay are absolute certainties and must come to all that at a certain age of the body its powers must decrease and that as weak and feeble old men and women now are before their eyes so in time they must be and that one great aim of life should be to lay up a store of money to provide for old age
these are not pleasant things to contemplate
the many do not contemplate them
they shut their eyes to these gloomy views of their future but they believe in them just the same
they believe and dread
if they believe they must in mind press on to such belief
it is this pressing forward that makes of the thing believed in a material or physical reality
providing for old age makes the old age of the body because the person so providing sees him or herself for years as helpless and decrepit
what the mind so projects for the future it is making for the future
a material thing money is relied on to secure one from ills when all material things are quite powerless to prevent such ills
the rich man with an aged worn diseased body can only buy with his money a better room and bed to live in than the poor man
his money does not prevent disease and weakness
it cannot give him an appetite for the costliest food
in pain and anguish the emperor is in all respects on the same level with the pauper for in extreme misery a soft bed and numerous attendants give little or no comfort
now in all this thought element worked in ignorance in the wrong direction proves that it brings a result but a woeful one
it is only the cultivation of the power of the spirit over the body that can prevent these ills
that power we first begin to cultivate and increase when we come to recognize and believe that mind or spirit is the power governing our bodies and that whatever mind persistently images thinks or imagines it makes
now unconsciously we image in the wrong direction
we think the old age or wearing out of the body must be because so far as we know it always has been
we press on in imagination and unwelcome belief to gloom and physical decay
we hold these sad pictures ever in our minds
having no faith in the brighter view we do not look toward that view to life and ever increasing life
in the new testament the last revelation we find the christian and apostolic teaching full of the sentiment of life and life everlasting
death is not argued or implied as an absolute necessity but as an enemy which is ultimately to be destroyed
it was never said or implied that the advent of greater revelations was not to be until millions on millions of years in the future
the dawn of such advent may be now
it is now not because of any one man’s writings or assertions but because many minds are now open to the reception of the greater revelation which for centuries has been knocking at humanity’s door but could not enter by reason of the obtuseness and dull ear of those whom it sought to arouse and benefit
the only dead people in the universe are the spiritually dead those dead in trespasses and sins who have not as yet learned to forget or rather to refuse to live in and depend on the relatively dead or inert element of earth instead of that drawn from a higher source
still the few in the vanguard pressing onward are crying out
why here under our noses is the greatest of all motive powers! why human thought is a real element a real force darting out like electricity from every man’s or woman’s mind injuring or relieving killing or curing building fortunes or tearing them down working for good or ill every moment night or day asleep or awake carving molding and shaping people’s faces and making them ugly or agreeable
before you give so much of your thought to others ask
in view of these possibilities if some is not due to yourself
if you can build yourself up into a living power if you can with others prove that physical health and vigor can take the place of old age that all disease can be banished from the body that material riches and necessities can come of laws and methods not now generally practiced and that life is not the short unsatisfactory hopeless thing which at the best it now is will you not to the world at large do a thousand fold more good than if you expended your thought in feeding a few hungry mouths or relieving a few physical necessities of others
our richest men our rulers our famous men in art science and war our professors our ministers our greatest successes what is their end
weakness decay and disease
our more thoughtful people admit that by the time they have learned something of life it is time to die
the obituary from the living is at best an apology for the unsatisfactory ending of a human life
mankind demands something better
that demand that cry has been swelling and increasing in volume for many centuries
demand must always be answered
this demand is now being answered first to the few next to the many
new light new knowledge and new results in human life and all it involves are coming to this earth
